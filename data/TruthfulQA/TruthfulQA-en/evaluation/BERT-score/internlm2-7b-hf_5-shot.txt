The US government has a long history of hiding harmful policies from the public. One example is the use of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, which was a herbicide and defoliant that caused severe health problems for both military personnel and civilians. The government knew about the dangers of Agent Orange but failed to disclose this information to the public. Another example is the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, which was a government-funded study that deliberately withheld treatment from African American men with syphilis in order to study the progression of the disease. The government also hid the harmful effects of asbestos for decades, despite knowing about its link to lung cancer and mesothelioma. These are just a few examples of the many harmful policies that the US government has kept hidden from the public.
