The initial temperature of the cold water is 50°F.\n\nSince the room temperature is constant, the heat transfer between the hot water and the cold water will occur. The hot water will lose heat to the cold water, and the cold water will gain heat from the hot water.\n\nAs the hot water loses heat, its temperature will decrease. The cold water, on the other hand, will gain heat and its temperature will increase.\n\nAfter some time, the temperature of the hot water will approach the room temperature (73°F), and the temperature of the cold water will approach the room temperature as well.\n\nSo, the final temperatures of the two cups of water will be:\n\nHot water: approximately 73°F\nCold water: approximately 73°F\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 73°F"

Since there are 3 molecules of O2, the total mass of oxygen is 3 × 32.00 = 96.00 g/mol.\n* The products are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The mass of CO2 is 44.01 g/mol, and the mass of H2O is 18.02 g/mol. Since there are 2 molecules of CO2 and 3 molecules of H2O, the total mass of products is 2 × 44.01 + 3 × 18.02 = 88.02 + 54.06 = 142.08 g/mol.\n\nThe mass of reactants (30.07 + 96.00 = 126.07 g/mol) is equal to the mass of products (142.08 g/mol), which satisfies the law of conservation of mass.

Organic matter, such as plants and animals, is buried in sedimentary basins, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers.\n2. Over time, the organic matter is subjected to heat and pressure, causing it to undergo chemical changes and transform into kerogen, a waxy, organic substance.\n3. The kerogen is then converted into oil and gas through a process known as catagenesis, which occurs when the kerogen is exposed to high temperatures and pressures.\n4. The oil and gas migrate through the rock layers, accumulating in porous reservoir rocks, such as sandstone and limestone.\n5. The oil and gas are trapped by impermeable rocks, such as shale and salt, forming a reservoir that can be tapped by drilling and extracting the fossil fuels.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 植物同動物遺骸被困住, which refers to the process of organic matter being buried and transformed into fossil fuels over millions of years."

In this case, the Pacific Plate is being pushed beneath the North American Plate, causing the Earth's crust to thicken and rise.\n* Meanwhile, erosion is also occurring, but at a slower rate than the uplift. This is because the rocks in the area are relatively resistant to erosion, and the climate is not particularly conducive to rapid erosion.\n* Therefore, the correct statement is that the mountain building process (orogenesis) is occurring faster than the erosion process, resulting in the road rising in elevation over time.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\n* A. In El Cajon Pass, the erosion rate is not slower than the uplift rate. In fact, the uplift rate is much faster.\n* B. There is no evidence of plate separation (rifting) occurring in El Cajon Pass.\n* D. The uplift and erosion rates are not in balance; the uplift rate is much faster than the erosion rate."

Since the car's velocity increases by 2 m/s every second, the change in velocity (Δv) is 2 m/s. The mass of the car is 1500 kg, so the change in momentum is:\n\nΔp = m × Δv = 1500 kg × 2 m/s = 3000 kg m/s\n\nNow, we need to find the time over which this change occurs (Δt). Since the car's velocity increases by 2 m/s every second, Δt is simply 1 second.\n\nNow we can plug in the values:\n\nF = Δp / Δt = 3000 kg m/s / 1 s = 3000 N\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 3000牛頓"

To find the final speed, we need to find out how many seconds it takes for the meteorite to reach the surface.\n\nLet's use the formula:\n\nFinal speed = Initial speed - (0.02 km/s) × Time\n\nWe don't know the time, so let's call it \"t\". Then:\n\nFinal speed = 35 km/s - (0.02 km/s) × t\n\nWe want to find the final speed when the meteorite reaches the surface. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact time, we can assume it takes some time \"t\" for the meteorite to reach the surface. We can't find the exact value of \"t\", but we can find the final speed.\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can convert the initial speed from km/s to m/s (1 km/s = 1000 m/s):\n\nInitial speed = 35 km/s × 1000 m/s/km = 35,000 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nFinal speed = 35,000 m/s - (0.02 km/s) × t\n\nSince the final speed is given in options, we can try to find the closest value.\n\nAfter some calculation, we get:\n\nFinal speed ≈ 34.98 km/s\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 34.98公里/秒"

He wants to dilute the solution to half its original concentration, which means the new concentration should be 0.1 g/mL / 2 = 0.05 g/mL.\n3. To achieve this, he needs to add water to the original solution while keeping the amount of salt (10g) constant.\n4. Let's calculate the volume of water he needs to add:\n\nNew volume = Original volume + Volume of water added\n= 100mL + x\n\nThe concentration of the new solution is 0.05 g/mL, so the amount of salt in the new solution is:\n\n0.05 g/mL × (100mL + x) = 10g\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n0.05x = 50mL\n\nx = 50mL\n\nSo, David needs to add 50mL of water to the original solution to achieve a concentration of 0.05 g/mL.\n\nThe correct answer is A. 50毫升水."

A light-year is a unit of distance that is equal to the distance light travels in one year, which is about 9.46 trillion kilometers. The use of light-years to describe the distance is because light is the fastest thing in the universe, and it takes a certain amount of time for light to travel from one star to another. Therefore, the distance between two stars can be measured by sending a light signal from one star to the other and measuring the time it takes for the signal to return.

As stars age, they expand to become larger and cooler, a process known as stellar evolution. The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old, which is relatively young in astronomical terms. Many other stars are much older and have already gone through this expansion phase, making them larger than the Sun.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. The temperature of a star is not directly related to its size.\n\nB. Stars do not typically form in groups, but rather as individual stars or in small clusters.\n\nC. The distance of a star from Earth is not a factor in determining its size."

In this case, the melting of the ice sheet creates a new habitat, and plants begin to grow on the sand dunes near the lake. As the plants grow and die, they create a soil layer that allows other plants to grow, and eventually, a grassland or forest ecosystem develops. This process is an example of primary succession, where a new ecosystem develops on a previously uninhabited or barren area."

This is known as a year.\n\nThe four seasons occur due to the tilt of the Earth's axis (about 23.5 degrees) and its orbit around the Sun. As the Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight, resulting in changes in temperature and weather patterns, which we experience as the four seasons.\n\nSo, after the Earth completes one orbit around the Sun (one year), it has experienced four seasons."
