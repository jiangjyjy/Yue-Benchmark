This minimizes water loss through evaporation compared to other methods.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\n* **a. 灌水效率 (Guǎnshuǐ xiàolǜ)** - This option translates to \"irrigation efficiency\" which is a bit too broad. While it's true that the efficiency of irrigation methods can vary, drip irrigation is inherently more efficient because of the direct water delivery to roots.\n\n* **b. 减少水分损失 (Jiǎn shǎo shuǐfèn shōng)** - This option translates to \"reduce water loss\" and is a characteristic of drip irrigation.\n\n* **d. a. 减少水资源浪费 (Dì shènzi yuanzi yuanz (Reduce water waste))** - This is a benefit of the method, not a reason for its use.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is **C**. \n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **a. 灌水量小 (Dǐ shì jiàn shǎo (Water supply is small))** - This is a common misconception.
