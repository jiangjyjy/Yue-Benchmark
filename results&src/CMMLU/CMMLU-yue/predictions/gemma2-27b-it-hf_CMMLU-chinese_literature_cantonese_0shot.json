Modernism and Realism)\n\nThis is because \"狂人日記\" (The Diary of a Madman) by Lu Xun is a work that blends elements of both **realism** and **modernism**. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Realism:** The story portrays the harsh realities of Chinese society in the early 20th century, including themes of social injustice, mental illness, and the clash between tradition and modernity.\n\n* **Modernism:** The use of a diary format allows for a unique narrative perspective and often employs modernist techniques like stream of consciousness and unreliable narration. The story also explores themes of alienation and the individual's struggle against societal norms, which are common in modernist literature.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to try another question!",

It mentions \"psychological description\" and \"externalization\" but doesn't provide a clear example of it.\n\n* **C. 因為「心理描寫」**\n\nThis option is **incorrect**. This option seems to be describing the concept of psychological realism, but the example given is not a clear indication of the answer.\n\n* **D. 喺中國傳統文學中，呢種手法用嚟描寫人物內心活動，例如「紅樓夢」**\n\nThis option is **correct**. It accurately states that the example given is a form of \"externalized\" psychological description, meaning the author reveals the character's thoughts and feelings through their actions and interactions with the environment, rather than explicitly stating them.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**\n\nThe passage you provided describes a scene where the character's inner world is revealed through their actions and thoughts. This is a classic example of how \"psychological description\" is used in literature. \n\n**Here's why option D is the best fit:**\n\n* **「心理描寫」** implies the description focuses on the character's internal state, which is a key element of **psychological realism**.\n* **「內化」** (internalization) is a technique where the author shows the character's inner thoughts and feelings through their actions and words.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore more about the different techniques used in Chinese literature!",
