    "llm_output": "The correct answer is C. 韋伯比率 (Weber's Law).\n\nWeber's Law states that the just-noticeable difference (JND) in a stimulus is proportional to the intensity of the stimulus. In other words, the relationship between the magnitude of a stimulus and the ability to detect a change in that stimulus is a logarithmic one. This means that as the intensity of the stimulus increases, the amount of change needed to be detected also increases, but at a slower rate.\n\nThis is in contrast to a linear relationship, which would suggest that the JND is constant regardless of the intensity of the stimulus.",
