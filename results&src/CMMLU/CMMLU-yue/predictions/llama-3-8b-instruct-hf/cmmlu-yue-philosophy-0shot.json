            "The correct answer is D. 絕對性同必然性 (Absolute and Necessity).\n\nIn philosophy, especially in the context of epistemology and metaphysics, the nature of sensory experience has been debated. Some philosophers argue that sensory experience is absolute, meaning that it is a direct and unmediated contact with reality, and that it is necessary, meaning that it is a fundamental and inescapable aspect of human existence. This view is often associated with philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and Edmund Husserl.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C do not accurately capture the nature of sensory experience. Option A suggests that sensory experience has both absolute and accidental aspects, which is not a coherent or widely accepted view. Option B suggests that sensory experience is relative and accidental, which is also not a widely accepted view. Option C suggests that sensory experience is relative and necessary, which is a possible view, but it is not the most widely accepted or accurate view."
