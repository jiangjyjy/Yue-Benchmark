Normalize the data to have zero mean).\n\nIn PCA, the projection matrix is calculated by finding the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data. To get the same projection as SVD, you need to normalize the data to have zero mean, which is the same as the first step in SVD. This is because SVD also starts by subtracting the mean of the data from each feature. By doing so, you ensure that the data is centered around zero, which is a necessary condition for both PCA and SVD to work correctly."
