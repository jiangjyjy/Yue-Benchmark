During this period, the sun's altitude at noon in Yixing (宜興) would first increase and then decrease.

    "llm_output": "The correct answer is D. 水土流失 (soil erosion).\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The location described (75°W, 45°N) is likely in the northeastern part of North America, such as Quebec or Ontario, Canada.\n* The description of the river being clear, the forest being dense, and the climate being suitable for human habitation suggests a region with a humid continental climate.\n* During the thawing season, the river would experience an increase in water flow and velocity due to the melting of snow and ice. This would lead to a higher risk of flooding (A), bank erosion (B), and ice jams (C).\n* However, soil erosion (D) is less likely to occur in this region during the thawing season, as the soil is typically frozen and less susceptible to erosion during this time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 水土流失 (soil erosion).",

The question states that the problem occurs due to a high amount of pollutants, not a small amount.\n\nB. While wind patterns can influence the dispersion of pollutants, it is not the main reason for the photochemical smog events in Mexico City during this period.\n\nC.
