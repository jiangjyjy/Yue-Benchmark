While the concept of \"ethnic quality\" is debated, it's generally understood that culture and traditions evolve and are influenced by various factors, including historical events and interactions with other cultures.\n\n* **B. 民族素質通過傳承持續存在，基本唔發生變異** is incorrect. Cultures are dynamic and change over time.\n\n* **C. 民族素質** is a term that refers to the collective characteristics of a people, such as their values, beliefs, and cultural traits. It is not simply the sum of individual traits.\n\n* **D. 民族素質** is a **綜合指標 (comprehensive indicator)** of a people's cultural and social development.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D**.\n\n**Note:**\n\nIt's important to note that the concept of \"民族素質\" (ethnic quality) is a complex one in anthropology. It can be a controversial term as it has been historically used to justify racist and ethnocentric ideologies.\n\nModern anthropologists tend to avoid using this term because it implies a static and essentialist view of culture, which is not accurate.\n\n**Cultures are dynamic and constantly changing, so option A is incorrect.**\n\n**Modern anthropologists recognize that cultures are not static entities, but rather dynamic processes that are constantly being shaped by their members. So option C is also incorrect.**\n\n**Option D is the most accurate answer** as it reflects the idea that \"ethnic quality\" is a complex concept that encompasses various aspects of a group's social and cultural development. However, it's crucial to remember that this term is often used in a way that is not considered appropriate by modern standards.\n\nIt's best to understand that **culture is a complex and evolving system** and avoid using \"ethnic quality\" as a measure of a group's worth."
