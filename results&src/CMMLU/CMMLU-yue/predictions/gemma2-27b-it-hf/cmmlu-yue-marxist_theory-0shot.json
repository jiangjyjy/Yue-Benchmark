This means that the value of a good is not determined by the amount of labor put into it by a single worker, but by the average amount of labor needed to produce it under normal conditions with average skill and efficiency.\n\n**Therefore, the phrase \"商品生產者\" (shàngpǐn shēngchǐng shíjiān**\n\n**個別勞動時間**\n\n**社會必要勞動時間**\n\n**個別勞動時間大於社會必要勞動時間**\n\n**This translates to \"individual labor time\" and \"socially necessary labor time\".**\n\n**The correct answer is the only one that reflects this concept of \"individual labor time\" being the key factor in the value of a commodity.**\n\n* **The concept of \"surplus value\" in Marxist theory:**\n\n**Marxist theory** also talks about \"surplus value,\" which is the difference between the value created by a worker and the wages they receive. This concept is related to the idea of \"value\" but focuses on the value a worker adds to the product beyond the value of their individual labor.\n\n**Therefore, the answer to your question is the option that reflects the idea that a worker's labor time should be equal to the socially necessary labor time for a product to be considered \"socially necessary\" labor time.**\n\n* **A. and B. are incorrect because they imply that the producer is paid for the time they spend producing the good.**\n\n* **B. 勞動時間等於商品**\n\n**A. 勞動時間等於**\n\n**社會必要勞動時間**\n\n**C. 個別勞動時間**\n\n**D.  **\n\n**The correct answer is C. 勞動時間 (lǎodòng shíjiān)**\n\n**A. 勞動時間**\n\n**B. 勞動時間**\n\n**C. 個別勞動時間 (勞動時間) is the correct answer.**\n\n**is a more accurate reflection of the concept of surplus value.**\n\n**The concept of \"socially necessary labor time\" is a central concept in Marx's theory of labor value.**\n\n**The correct answer is the answer to the question, but it is not the only one.**\n\n**D. 勞動時間 (lǎodòng shíjiān)**\n\n**C. is the correct answer because it directly relates to the concept of the \"value of labor\" in the context of the individual worker.**\n\n**is the answer because it reflects the concept of the \"socially necessary labor time\" being a factor in the value of a commodity.**\n\n**Let me know if you'd like to explore more about these concepts!

This is the core of the concept.** The idea is that the proletariat (working class) needs to hold the power to guide the transition to a socialist society, ensuring the means of production are controlled by the people.\n\n* **C. and D.** are incorrect because they are too simplistic. While these are goals of a socialist society in the Marxist view, the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" is about the process of achieving that transition.\n\n**The \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" is a complex concept in Marxist theory.** It refers to the idea that after a socialist revolution, the working class, through its vanguard party, would need to establish a temporary period of authoritarian rule to transition to a communist society. This temporary \"dictatorship\" is not meant to be a permanent state of one class ruling over another, but rather a period where the working class takes control of the state apparatus to dismantle the existing capitalist structures and build a new socialist society based on the principles of equality and worker control.\n\n**It's important to note:**\n\nThe term \"proletariat dictatorship\" is often debated. Some argue it's a necessary stage for a socialist society to transition to communism, while others criticize it as a contradiction in terms, as they believe it undermines the Marxist concept of a classless society.\n\n**In the context of your question, the correct answer is (B) because it best reflects the core concept of the working class using its newfound control of the state to enact socialist policies and dismantle the old capitalist structures.**\n\nIt's crucial to understand that this concept is not about establishing a permanent dictatorship of the working class, but about the **transitional period** after the revolution. During this period, the working class, through its political organization, would hold power and use it to **implement socialist policies** and gradually transition to a stateless communist society.\n\n**It's also important to remember that the term \"dictatorship\" in this context is not meant to be understood in the same way we think of it today.** In Marxist theory, the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" is a theoretical concept of a **temporary state of political power** held by the working class to transition to a communist society.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to know more about the transition to a socialist society."

It suggests that social factors, particularly the division of labor, play a significant role.\n\n* **Social context shapes individual potential:**  While the quote mentions the \"primitive\" nature of the difference, it's not saying that everyone is equally intelligent. It's pointing out that social and economic structures can create and reinforce inequalities, leading to disparities in opportunities and access to education.\n\nLet's break down the meaning of the quote:\n\n* **Marx's point:** The quote suggests that the \"original difference\" between a working-class person and a person from a privileged background (in this case, represented by the \"difference\" between a working-class dog and a \"higher\" class dog) is not as significant as the difference between a \"working dog\" and a \"thinking person\".\n\n* **Meaning:** This quote is a critique of the idea that social and political differences are solely based on individual merit. Marx argues that these differences are a product of the social system, specifically the division of labor, which can limit the potential for intellectual development for those who are forced into manual labor by their economic circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the quote \"搬運工同哲學家之間嘅鴻溝，其實比由社會政治地位所造成嘅差異更小\" (The original difference between a laborer and a philosopher is much smaller than the difference between a working-class dog and a hunting dog, which is a much more complex social division of labor) emphasizes that the **social division of labor** can limit the development of individuals and create a **division between those who perform manual labor and those who perform intellectual labor**."

This means that the way a society produces and distributes resources fundamentally shapes everything else about that society.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\n* **A. 社會發展和社會變革的先導** (Social development determines a country's national development) while true in a broader sense, is too general.\n\nMarxist theory focuses on how the **mode of production** (how a society produces its goods and services) influences the **base** of society. \n\n* **B.  決定咗社會發展的趨勢** (Material conditions determine the trend of social development) and **C.  決定** (determines the development of a nation) are incorrect because they imply the **economic base** dictates the entire course of a nation's development, not just its ultimate outcome.\n\nWhile the **economic base** is the foundation, it's the **economic base** that influences a nation's development, not the other way around.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to try some more practice questions!"

This concept is directly related to the development of a communist society.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Marxism and Alienation:** Marx argued that under capitalism, people become alienated from their labor, the products they create, the products they consume, from each other, and from their own \"species-being\" (the potential for humans to develop their full potential as creative beings). This alienation leads to a lack of fulfillment and control over their lives.\n\n* **Communism and Emancipation:**  Communist society, as envisioned by Marx, is a society where people are free from the exploitation of capitalism and the division of labor. This means people are not alienated from the products of their labor, the process of production, or the social world.\n\n* **Socialist Transition:**\n\nSocialists believe that a communist society is achieved through a transition period after socialism.\n\n**Therefore, the development of \"free individuality\" is associated with a communist society in Marxist theory.**\n\nIt's important to note that Marx believed this communist society would be achieved through a revolution that overthrew capitalism. He argued that the true liberation of the individual would only be possible after the abolition of private property and the establishment of a classless society.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!"

This theory argues that the value of a commodity is based on the **labor** required to produce it, and that the **value** of a commodity is a product of the social relations of production.\n\nThe concept of **價值 (value)** in this context is more complex than just the price of something. It's about the **socially necessary labor time** embedded in the production of that good.\n\n**The concept of 價值 (value)** is central to Marxism's understanding of how capitalism works.\n\n**In summary, the correct answer is C. 價值 (Value) because it represents the core concept of the Marxist critique of value exchange.**"
