This implies a power dynamic, as the other options focus on the content itself (which is not directly controlled by the owner) or the broader context of journalistic ethics and legal frameworks. \n\nWhile capitalists can influence news coverage through various means like funding, they don't directly control the *content* of the news. They might have influence through **B. 新聞傳播嘅方向** (news coverage direction) due to their ownership of media outlets, but the question asks about the \"direction of news coverage\" in a broader sense, implying a potential influence on the editorial decisions of the news.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is **B. 新聞傳播嘅方向** (the direction of news coverage) as it directly reflects the influence of ownership on the editorial direction of the news."

Allow them time to think and formulate their answers.\n* **Create a safe space:** Choose a quiet, private location for the interview.
