This is not the relationship being described in the question.\n\n* **感覺的差異 (Differential Threshold)** refers to the minimum difference between two stimuli that a person can detect.\n\nThe question asks for the term used to describe the intensity of a stimulus that can be perceived. This is **絕對感覺閾限 (Absolute Threshold)**.\n\n* **正比 (Just Noticeable Difference)** is the minimum difference in stimulus intensity that is required for a person to detect a change.\n\nThis means the answer is **B. 差別感覺閾限 (Differential Threshold)**, **正比 (proportional)**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe question is asking about the concept of **Just Noticeable Difference (JND)**.\n\n* **Just noticeable difference** is directly related to the intensity of the original stimulus.\n\nThe correct answer is **(b) 差別感覺閾限，正比 (Just Noticeable Difference, proportional)**.\n\nThis refers to the fact that the just noticeable difference is a **proportion** of the original stimulus intensity.\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe question is asking for the concept of a \"threshold\" in the context of perception, and the relationship between the intensity of the original stimulus and the JND.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThe term used in the question is likely a translation error. \"差別感覺閾限\" is the Chinese translation for \"Just Noticeable Difference\", but the question likely meant to ask about the **relationship between stimulus intensity and the JND**.\n\n**Important:**\n\nThe correct answer is **(b) 差異閾限，正比 (Just Noticeable Difference, proportional)** because the question is about the relationship between the **intensity of a stimulus** and the **smallest detectable change** in that stimulus. The JND is the **smallest difference** between two stimuli that a person can reliably detect, and it's **directly proportional** to the intensity of the original stimulus.\n\nThis means:\n\n* **The stronger the original stimulus, the larger the JND.** You need a bigger difference in the intensity of a bright light to notice a change in brightness compared to a dim light.\n\n* **The smaller the JND, the harder it is to detect a change in the stimulus.**\n\n\n",

    "llm_output": "D. 升華 \n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n升華 (Sublimation) is a defense mechanism where unacceptable urges are channeled into socially acceptable activities. For example, a person with aggressive tendencies might become a boxer or a wrestler.\n\nThe other options are also psychological defense mechanisms, but they are not considered \"avoidant\" in the same way:\n\n* **A. 補償 (Compensation):** This involves overachieving in one area to make up for perceived deficiencies in another.\n* **B. 轉移 (Displacement):** This is a defense mechanism where negative emotions are redirected to a less threatening target.\n* **C. 壓抑 (Repression):** This involves unconsciously pushing unwanted thoughts and feelings out of awareness.\n\nWhile **displacement** (B) and **denial** (C) are related to sublimation, they are not the same. Sublimation is a specific type of defense mechanism where the other options are more general.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to know more about any of these mechanisms!",

    "llm_output": "C. 持久性 \n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhile all the options listed are important aspects of memory to some extent, **持久性 (persistence)** is considered the most crucial. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **持久性 (persistence)** refers to the **duration** of memory storage.  For information to be useful, it needs to be retained for a meaningful amount of time. This is the core function of memory - to **store information** for later retrieval.\n\n* **準確性 (accuracy)** is important, but it's less about how well you remember something and more about the **fidelity** of the memory. A memory can be persistent (lasting a long time) but inaccurate.\n\n* **準備性 (encoding)** and **持久性 (retrieval)** are both important for memory formation, but they are processes involved in getting information into memory and accessing it, respectively. These processes are essential for creating and using memories, but they don't guarantee a memory will be long-lasting.\n\nTherefore, the ability to store information for a **long duration** is the most fundamental characteristic of memory.",

The statement implies that the teacher is making judgments about the student's behavior based on preconceived notions rather than objective observation, which is the core of the **stereotype effect**.\n\nThe **stereotype effect** is a phenomenon where our expectations about a person or group of people (in this case, based on their appearance) influence our perception of their behavior.\n\nTherefore, **C. 刻板印象效應 (Stereotype Effect)** is the most accurate answer. \n\n\n",

So, this is a **correct** description of preoperational thinking.\n* **C. 思維嘅自我中心性 (Egocentrism):** This is a key concept of Piaget's theory of cognitive development, specifically during the preoperational stage. So, **C is incorrect** as it's a characteristic of the stage, not a characteristic that disappears.\n\n**Correct answer:** **C.  自我中心性 (Egocentrism)**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe preoperational stage is characterized by **egocentric thinking**, meaning children struggle with understanding perspectives other than their own. This is a defining feature of this stage, not something that disappears. \n\n**Key concepts of the preoperational stage (according to Piaget) include:**\n\n* **C.  自我中心性 (Egocentrism):** This is the **incorrect** answer as it refers to a characteristic of the stage, not a unique description of the stage itself.\n* **A. 單維思維 (Egocentric thinking):** This is a **characteristic** of the preoperational stage.\n* **B.  A.  自我中心性 (Egocentrism) is a characteristic of the preoperational stage:** This is a **correct** description of the stage.\n\n**Egocentrism** is a common term used to describe the stage, but it's important to remember that it's a **stage of cognitive development** characterized by the **inability to take another person's perspective**.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore more about the preoperational stage!",
