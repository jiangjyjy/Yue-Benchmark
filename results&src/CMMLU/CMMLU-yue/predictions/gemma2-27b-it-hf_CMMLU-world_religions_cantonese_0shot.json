While some Christians may practice self-denial, it is not a requirement for belief.\n\nThe **Incarnation**, the idea that **God became human in the person of Jesus Christ**, is a central concept in **Christianity**, but not necessarily in all other religions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **B**.\n\n**C. 靈與肉的合二為一** is the most accurate answer because it directly addresses the core concept of the Christian faith, which is the **relationship between the human and the divine**.\n\n**C. \n\nThe answer is not **B. 禁慾主義 (Asceticism)**, as this option describes a specific aspect of some religious practices, not the core belief of Christianity.\n\n**C. 靈與物質的合二為一 (The union of spirit and matter)** is a key concept in **Christianity**, emphasizing the belief that God became **incarnate** in the human person of **Jesus Christ**. This concept is central to the Christian faith, as it is the foundation of the belief in the **divine nature of Jesus**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **C**.\n\n**C. 靈與物質的對立 (The denial of physical desires)** is a core belief of **Christianity**, but not the core belief of all religions.\n\nThe answer is **C. 靈與物質的對立**.\n\nChristianity emphasizes the **duality of the human being**, consisting of a **spiritual soul** and a **physical body**.\n\nThe **Incarnation** is a core concept of **Christianity** that can be seen as a **reconciliation of this duality**, as Jesus is believed to have been both fully **God and fully human**.\n\nThis concept is often misunderstood and can be **interpreted as a dualistic view** in some Christian denominations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **C**.\n\n**C. \n\nThe answer is **C. 靈與物質的對立 (the spirit and the flesh)**.\n\n**C. 靈與物質的對立 (Christianity)** is a **belief system** that emphasizes the **belief in a spiritual realm** that exists alongside the physical world.\n\nChristianity teaches that **God** is **spiritual** and **humans** are **physical beings**.\n\nThe **relationship between the physical and the spiritual** is a central theme in **Christian theology**.\n\nTheology is the study of God and religious beliefs.\n\nThe answer is **C. 靈與物質的合二為一** is the most accurate answer because it directly addresses the **Christian belief in the unity of spirit and body**.\n\n**C. 靈與物質的對立 (The duality of the human being)** is a key concept in Christianity, as it is believed that humans are made up of",

Judaism, like many religions, has a complex set of beliefs and practices, and while it emphasizes justice, it does not advocate for vengeance.\n\n* **D. 猶太教係宗教，而基督教係主張寬容的 (Judaism is a religion, while Christianity emphasizes forgiveness):** This is also a false dichotomy. Judaism and Christianity both have complex ethical and theological frameworks.\n\n**The theological split between Judaism and Christianity stems from the emergence of the New Testament and the belief in Jesus as the Messiah.**\n\nJudaism does not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while Christianity considers him to be the central figure of the faith.

Both religions have complex beliefs and practices, and option C is a more nuanced and accurate representation of the difference.\n\n* **The core of the theological difference lies in the interpretation of Jesus's role.** While option C is a simplified explanation, it highlights the key point of divergence.\n\n* The **emergence of the New Testament** and the belief in Jesus as the Messiah led to the development of Christianity as a separate religion from Judaism.\n\n* **Christianity** is based on the belief that Jesus is the Son of God and the promised Messiah, while **Judaism** does not recognize Jesus as a divine figure.\n\n* **Theological differences** are not about one religion being \"simple\" and the other \"complex,\" but about different interpretations of scripture, religious practice, and the nature of God.\n\n* **The answer choices are not mutually exclusive.** A person can be both religious and moral without being Jewish or Christian.\n\n* **The question implies a specific historical and theological context.** The emergence of Christianity as a distinct religion from Judaism is a complex historical and theological event, and the answer choices suggest a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between the two faiths.\n\n**Therefore, the most accurate answer to the question \"Christianity 徹底 (thoroughly) 分道揚鑣 (diverged) from Judaism\" due to the specific wording of the question, is C. \n\n**C. 因為耶穌被認為是新教導的救世主，而基督教認為**\n\nThis option is the most accurate because it highlights the core difference between the two religions: their understanding of Jesus.\n\n* **C. 猶太教係宗教，而基督教被認為是**\n\nThis option is the most accurate because it reflects the core difference between the two religions: their understanding of Jesus.\n\n* **B. 猶太教有...
