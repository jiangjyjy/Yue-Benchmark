They are a global phenomenon, affecting regions around the world.\n\n* **B. Incorrect.**  Monsoon climates are characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, not just high temperatures in the summer.\n\n* **C. Incorrect.** This is a common misconception. Monsoon winds are not just for summer.\n\n* **D. Correct.** Monsoons are primarily driven by the seasonal temperature differences between land and sea.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**\n\nMonsoons are indeed strongly influenced by the difference in heat capacity between land and sea. Land heats up and cools down faster than water, leading to the seasonal shift in wind patterns. \n\n\n",

Different crops have different climate requirements.\n2. **Soil:**  Fertile soil is crucial for agriculture. Soil fertility, drainage, and soil depth all play a role in determining what can be grown and how successfully.\n3. **Market:** Farmers need to be able to sell their products, so proximity to markets is important for transportation costs and access to consumers.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore the influence of specific geographic factors on agriculture.",

This refers to the use of ingredients like wild mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and other produce found in the mountainous regions of Anhui.\n\n* **c. \n\n**c.
