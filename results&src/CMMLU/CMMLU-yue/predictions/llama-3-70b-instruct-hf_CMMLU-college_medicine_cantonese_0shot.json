This is because the intestine's primary function is to absorb nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, rather than to metabolize glycerol.",

The physical examination findings, such as abdominal tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness, suggest peritonitis. The laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, indicating an inflammatory response.\n\nGiven the patient's hemodynamic instability, the priority is to restore blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs. Rapid fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support are necessary to treat shock and prevent further deterioration.",
