Leave-one-out cross-validation: This method involves training the model on all samples except one, and testing on that one sample. This process is repeated for all 1000 samples, resulting in 1000 iterations. This method is the most computationally expensive.\n* iii. 5-fold cross-validation: This method involves dividing the dataset into 5 folds, training the model on 4 folds, and testing on the remaining fold.

Repeated 2 times 5-fold cross-validation: This method involves repeating the 5-fold cross-validation process 2 times, resulting in 10 iterations.\n* i.

This process can be repeated multiple times, but the number of iterations is not fixed.\n\nIn terms of computational complexity, leave-one-out cross-validation is the most expensive, followed by repeated 5-fold cross-validation, then 5-fold cross-validation, and finally the bootstrap method with replacement.
