    "llm_output": "The correct answer is C. 芝諾 (Zeno of Elea). Zeno of Elea is known for his paradoxes, including the four paradoxes of motion, which are:\n\n1. The Dichotomy Paradox: To move from point A to point B, you must first cover half the distance, then half of the remaining distance, and so on ad infinitum.\n2. The Achilles Paradox: The fastest runner will never catch up to a slower runner, because the slower runner can always be made to move half the distance between them.\n3. The Arrow Paradox: An arrow in flight is never actually moving, because it is always in the process of moving from one position to another.\n4. The Stadium Paradox: A group of runners is moving along a track, but because they are moving at different speeds, they will never actually reach the end of the track.\n\nThese paradoxes were meant to challenge the concept of motion and the nature of reality, and are still studied and debated by philosophers today.",

    "llm_output": "The correct answer is D. 絕對性同必然性 (Absolute and Necessity).\n\nIn philosophy, especially in the context of epistemology and metaphysics, the nature of sensory experience has been debated. Some philosophers argue that sensory experience is absolute, meaning that it is a direct and unmediated contact with reality, and that it is necessary, meaning that it is a fundamental and inescapable aspect of human existence. This view is often associated with philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and Edmund Husserl.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and C do not accurately capture the nature of sensory experience. Option A suggests that sensory experience has both absolute and accidental aspects, which is not a coherent or widely accepted view. Option B suggests that sensory experience is relative and accidental, which is also not a widely accepted view. Option C suggests that sensory experience is relative and necessary, which is a possible view, but it is not the most widely accepted or accurate view.",
