Ethnicity encompasses a range of cultural factors, including shared language, ancestry, traditions, and a sense of shared identity. \n\n* **People often identify with their ethnicity in complex and individual ways.**  They might identify with one parent's ethnicity more strongly, or with a combination of their parents' and other ancestral backgrounds.\n\n* **Culturally, individuals often identify with the ethnicity of their family, community, or the one they feel most connected to.** This means their ethnicity is not just determined by their parents but also by their cultural upbringing and personal identification.\n\n\nTherefore, a person's ethnicity cannot be definitively determined by just knowing their father's or mother's ethnicity.

While Marxists believe in the equality of all people, including those of different nationalities, \"民族平等\" (ethnic equality) is not the defining characteristic of how they approach the issue.\n\n* **根本原則** (fundamental principle) is a more general term and not specific to the Marxist approach.\n\n* **基本出發點** (basic starting point) is a more accurate translation of **\"民族平等\"** (ethnic equality) as it translates to \"fundamental principle\" of Marxist thought.\n\n* **民族平等** (民族 equality) is the core concept of **equality of all people** in the context of social and economic justice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **B. 基本出發點**. \n\nIt's important to note that the concept of \"民族平等\" (national equality) is a complex one, and while it is a value held by Marxists, it's not the only one.\n\n**\"民族平等\"** (民族 equality) emphasizes the equality of all people regardless of their ethnicity. This aligns with the Marxist concept of **equality as a fundamental principle** in their broader ideology of achieving a classless society.\n\nHowever, **Marxists believe in the equality of all people in terms of class, not necessarily ethnicity**. While they advocate for social and economic equality, they don't always explicitly use the term \"民族平等\" (national equality).\n\nTherefore, **\"民族平等\"** is a **precondition** for the **ultimate goal of a classless society**, but not necessarily a core concept of the Marxist ideology.\n\nThe most accurate translation of \"民族平等\" in this context is **\"equality of nations\"** or **\"national equality\"**.

However, it's crucial to remember that this term is often used in a way that is not considered appropriate by modern standards.\n\nIt's best to understand that **culture is a complex and evolving system** and avoid using \"ethnic quality\" as a measure of a group's worth.",
