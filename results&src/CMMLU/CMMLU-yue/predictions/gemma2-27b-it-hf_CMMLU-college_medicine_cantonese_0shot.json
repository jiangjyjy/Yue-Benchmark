In this case, the tidal volume is 500ml.\n\n* **Physiological Dead Space (PD):** This is the volume of air that remains in the conducting airways (where no gas exchange occurs) and doesn't participate in gas exchange.\n\n* **Dead Space Ventilation:** This refers to the volume of air that stays in the conducting airways and doesn't reach the alveoli for gas exchange.\n\n* **Alveolar Ventilation:** This is the volume of air that actually reaches the alveoli (the functional respiratory unit where gas exchange takes place) per minute.\n\n**Calculating Alveolar Ventilation:**\n\nTo find the alveolar ventilation, we use the following formula:\n\n**Alveolar Ventilation = (TV - Dead Space Ventilation) x (Breathing Rate)**\n\nSince we know the person's tidal volume is 500 ml and their breathing rate is 18 breaths per minute, the answer is (500 ml - 150 ml) x (18 breaths/minute) = 6300 ml.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to try another practice question! \n",

    "question": "下列邊啲情況可使心輸出量增加",
    "llm_output": "The correct answer is **B. 由平臥位轉為立體位**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **心輸出量 (Cardiac Output)** is the amount of blood the heart pumps per minute. It's calculated by multiplying heart rate by stroke volume.\n\n* **心輸出量 (Cardiac Output)** increases when you stand up because gravity pulls blood downwards, which means your body needs to work harder to pump blood back to the heart. This increase in **心輸出量** is due to the body's natural mechanism to compensate for the increased demand on the circulatory system.\n\nLet's break down the other options:\n\n* **A. 頸動脈竇內壓降低 (Carotid sinus pressure decreases)**: This is incorrect. A decrease in carotid sinus pressure would actually *decrease* cardiac output, as the body senses the drop in blood pressure and tries to lower the blood flow to the heart.\n\n* **C. 心率加快超出180次/分 (Heart rate increases beyond 180 beats/minute)**: This is incorrect. While a higher heart rate can contribute to a higher cardiac output, the statement specifies a change in **心輸出量** due to a decrease in blood flow to the heart. A heart rate of 180 bpm is extremely high and would likely be triggered by a physiological response to a sudden drop in blood pressure.\n\n* **D. 心舒張末期容積 (Heart rate increases beyond 180 beats/minute)**: This is incorrect. This option describes a specific condition (heart rate increasing) but doesn't explain why it would increase cardiac output.\n\nLet me know if you'd like more explanation on why changing position affects cardiac output.",

It's primarily influenced by the **force of your heart's contraction**, which is directly related to the **amount of blood your heart pumps out with each beat (stroke volume)**. \n\nThe other options are less directly related to systolic pressure:\n\n* **A. 外周阻力 (Peripheral Resistance):** While peripheral resistance is a factor in blood pressure, it primarily affects the **diastolic pressure**, which is the pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats.\n* **B. 心率 (Heart Rate):** Heart rate plays a role in blood pressure, but it's more accurate to say it influences the **overall cardiac output**. A high heart rate can contribute to a higher systolic pressure, but it's the amount of blood pumped per heart beat (stroke volume) that primarily determines the systolic pressure itself.\n\nTherefore, **心率 (Heart Rate)** is the most accurate answer as it directly relates to the pressure generated during each heartbeat. \n\nLet me know if you'd like to know more about blood pressure or any other related topic!",

    "question": "男性，23歲。因乏力10天、牙齦出血伴皮膚瘀斑4天入院，既往體健。化驗血Hb 76 g/L，WBC 25X10^9/L，Plt 29X10^9/L，骨髓增生明顯活躍，原始細胞佔60%，POX染色(-)，PAS染色(+)成塊，NSE染色(-)。該患者首選嘅治療方案係",
    "llm_output": "The correct answer is **(C) DVLP**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **COP, ABVD, and ABVD** are all chemotherapy regimens used to treat certain types of lymphoma. \n* **COP** stands for Cyclophosphamide, Oncovin (vincristine), and Prednisone. It's a common regimen for treating **diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)**.\n* **Pox staining** is used to identify the presence of peroxidase in cells, which is typically positive in myeloid cells. A negative result here suggests the issue is not with myeloid lineage.\n* **The (-) for NSE staining is important.** NSE is a marker for neuroendocrine cells. The fact that it's negative in this case means the patient doesn't have a neuroendocrine tumor.\n\n**Explanation of the Answer:**\n\nThe presence of (+) PAS staining indicates a possible diagnosis of **Hodgkin's lymphoma**, which is often diagnosed by a biopsy.  A negative (-) result for both NSE and the (-) result for the PAS staining is a strong indicator of a lymphoid origin for the patient's condition.\n\nSince the patient is a 23-year-old male with a negative peroxidase staining, it's more likely he has a **non-Hodgkin's lymphoma** as this is the more common type. \n\n**DVLP** is a specific chemotherapy regimen used to treat Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n**Therefore, the most likely best treatment option for this patient is a regimen used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is why (A) is the correct answer.**\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nThis is a simplified explanation.  **Only a qualified medical professional can make a diagnosis and recommend a specific treatment plan.**\n\nIt's crucial to understand that:\n\n* **This information is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as medical advice.**\n* **A (-) peroxidase staining result is a key characteristic of a DLBCL diagnosis.**\n\n* **A medical professional should be consulted for any medical concerns or before making decisions about your health or treatment.**",

This means that once the threshold is reached, the action potential will always be the same amplitude and the neuron will fire.\n\nLet's break down why A. and B. are incorrect:\n\n* **A. is incorrect:** An action potential's amplitude is not dependent on the stimulus strength. A stronger stimulus will only trigger more frequent action potentials, not stronger individual ones.\n\n* **B. is incorrect:** The \"all-or-none\" principle applies to action potentials.  A weak stimulus will not trigger an action potential.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the concept of action potentials and why **C. is correct:**\n\n* **Action Potentials:** These are electrical signals that neurons use to communicate.\n\n* **Threshold:** A stimulus must reach a certain strength (the threshold) to trigger an action potential.\n\n* **All-or-None Principle:** This principle states that the strength of an action potential is constant.

    "llm_output": "The correct answer is **A. 腫瘤細胞嘅去分化**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **腫瘤間變 (tumor heterogeneity)** refers to the diversity of cells within a tumor. This means that not all cancer cells within a tumor are identical, they can have different genetic and phenotypic profiles.\n\nLet's break down the other options:\n\n* **B. 腫瘤親子代之間嘅遺傳特性繼承 (tumor inheritance)** is not a recognized term in the context of cancer.\n* **C. 惡性腫瘤 (惡性 = malignant) 發生 (occurrence) 嘅一種癌前病變 (precancerous lesion)** describes a process that happens in cancer development, but not the concept of tumor heterogeneity itself.\n* **D. 良惡性腫瘤 (良性 = benign) 發生 (occurrence) 過程中嘅 (of) 腫瘤 (tumor) 嘅 (of) 形態 (morphology) 嘅 (of) 變化 (change) (cancer development)** refers to the changes in a tumor's characteristics over time, which is a related but not the defining characteristic of tumor heterogeneity.\n\n**Therefore, the most accurate answer to describe the core concept of tumor heterogeneity is the presence of diverse cell populations within a tumor (A).**\n\nTumor heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon that arises from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes within tumor cells. This means that even within the same tumor, there are variations in the genetic makeup and behavior of individual cancer cells. This variability can lead to differences in:\n\n* **Tumor aggressiveness:** Some cells may be more aggressive than others, leading to different rates of growth and spread.\n* **Response to treatment:**  This is where the concept of \"heterogeneity\" comes into play most directly. Different cell populations within a tumor can have different sensitivities to treatment.\n\nThis is a simplified explanation, but it highlights why **A. 腫瘤細胞嘅去分化** is the most accurate answer.\n\nIt's important to note that the term \"heterogeneity\" itself is a broad term. While it's true that all cancers are diverse, the concept of tumor heterogeneity is often used to specifically refer to the **genetic and phenotypic diversity** within a tumor.\n\n\n",
