The vaccination data from the health station shows that vaccinated dogs are less likely to transmit rabies, but the insurance company's data shows that people bitten by vaccinated dogs are more likely to get rabies. This is because people tend to vaccinate their dogs only after they have already shown symptoms of rabies, and they are also more likely to live in areas with high rabies incidence rates. This means that the vaccinated dogs are already infected with rabies, and the vaccination is not effective in preventing transmission. Therefore, people bitten by these dogs are more likely to get rabies.",
