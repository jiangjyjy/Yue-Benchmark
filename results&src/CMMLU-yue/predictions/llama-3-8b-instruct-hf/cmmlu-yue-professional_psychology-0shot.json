This is in contrast to social learning theory (A), which suggests that language acquisition is primarily learned through social interaction, or conditioning theory (B), which suggests that language acquisition is the result of conditioning and reinforcement. The strengthening theory (D) is not a widely accepted theory of language acquisition."
