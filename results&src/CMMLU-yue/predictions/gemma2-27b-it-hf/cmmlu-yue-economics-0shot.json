            "The answer is **A. 本身嘅價格**\n\nThis translates to \"**A. Other factors**\" in English.\n\nThe question is asking for the factors that cause a shift in the supply curve, which is a fundamental concept in economics.\n\nHere's why:\n\nIn economics, the **supply curve** illustrates the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity supplied.  \n\n* **Changes in price** cause movement *along* the supply curve (a change in quantity supplied). This is a change in price of the product itself.\n\nThe question asks for the factors that cause a shift in the supply curve, which means a change in something *other* than the price of the good.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the answer choices and why they are correct:\n\n* **A. 其他因素** (other factors) - This is the correct answer. A shift in the supply curve occurs when a factor *other* than price changes, such as:\n    * **Changes in the cost of production:** This includes the cost of raw materials, labor, and capital. If these costs increase, the supply curve will shift to the left, indicating a decrease in quantity supplied at every price level. Conversely, if these costs decrease, the supply curve will shift to the right, signifying an increase in quantity supplied.\n\n* **B. 偏好** (preferences) - This is a factor that affects demand, not a supply shift.\n\n* **C. 技術** (technology) -  Technological advancements can shift the supply curve. For example, if a new technology makes it cheaper to produce a good, the quantity supplied will increase.\n\n* **D. 產量** (output) -  This is a result of changes in the supply of a good, not a cause of a shift in the supply curve.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **A. 其他因素** (other factors).\n\nHere are some examples of **other factors** that can cause a shift in the supply curve:\n\n* **Changes in input prices:** If the price of a key input, like raw materials, increases, the cost of production goes up, and the supply curve shifts left.\n* **Changes in technology:** New technology can make production more efficient, leading to a rightward shift in the supply curve.\n* **Changes in government policy:** Taxes, subsidies, and regulations can all affect the supply curve.\n\n* **Changes in the number of sellers:** More sellers in a market generally means a higher supply, shifting the curve right.\n\n* **Government taxes and subsidies:** A tax on a good will shift the supply curve left, as the cost of production will increase.\n\n* **Natural disasters:** A natural disaster that affects the production of a good will shift the supply curve left.\n\n* **Changes in consumer income and tastes:** These factors are not directly related to the supply curve, but rather to the demand for a product.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions."

            "The answer is **A. 340件**.\n\nHere's why:\n\nTo find the minimum output needed to achieve a profit target, we need to consider the break-even point. This is the point where total revenue equals total cost, resulting in zero profit.\n\nThe formula for break-even point (in units) is:\n\n**Break-Even Point (in units) = Fixed Costs / (Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)**\n\nIn this case:\n\n* **Fixed Costs:** 1800 蚊\n* **Price per Unit:** 23 蚊\n* **Variable Cost per Unit:** 13 蚊\n* **Profit:**  Profit is the target, so we need to know the output level that will result in a profit of 600 蚊.\n\nLet's calculate the break-even point:\n\n* **Break-Even Point (in units) = 1800 蚊 / (23 蚊/件 - 1800 蚊 / (Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit))**\n\nWe can see that the break-even point is dependent on the **Price per Unit** and **Variable Cost per Unit**.  To calculate the minimum quantity to achieve a profit of 600 蚊, we need to know the cost structure of the production process.\n\nSince the problem only provides the fixed cost and the selling price per unit, we can assume the following:\n\n* **Variable Cost per Unit:** 13 蚊 (This is the price the producer needs to pay to produce one unit)\n\n**To achieve a profit, the total revenue (price per unit x quantity) must exceed the total cost (fixed cost + variable cost per unit).**\n\nTherefore, the minimum output needed to achieve a profit of 630 蚊 (Fixed Cost + Profit = 600 蚊 + 600 蚊 = 1300 蚊) is:\n\n* **Minimum Break-Even Quantity = 1800 蚊 / (23 蚊/件 - 13 蚊/件) = 1800 蚊 / 10 錢 = 180 units**\n* **Minimum Cost to Achieve Profit = 1800 錢 / (Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit) x 6 錢**\n\nSince the problem asks for the minimum quantity to achieve a profit, we can calculate the minimum quantity needed to reach a profit of 600 錢 (180 錢)\n\n* **Minimum Quantity = 600 錢 / (Price per Unit) = 600 錢 / (Price per Unit + Variable Cost per Unit)**\n\nThis is the minimum quantity needed to achieve a profit of 600 錢 (180 錢).\n\n**Therefore, the answer is A. 600 錢 (600 錢 is the same as 600 units of the product)**\n\n* **Profit = (Price per Unit x Quantity) - (Cost per unit x Quantity) - (Fixed Cost**\n\n* **Minimum Cost per Unit = 6 錢 / (Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)**\n\nTo achieve a profit of 600 units, the quantity needed to be sold is:\n\n* **Minimum Quantity = 600 錢 / (23 錢/unit - 13 錢/unit) = 600 錢 / 10 錢 = 60 units**\n\nTherefore, the profit-maximizing quantity is **180 units**.\n\n**To achieve a profit of 13 錢 (Profit = 13 錢)**\n\n* **Minimum Quantity = 600 錢 / (Price per unit - Variable Cost per Unit)**\n\n**This is a trick question!**\n\nThe key here is that the question asks for the minimum quantity needed to achieve a profit of 600 錢 (which is 600/10 = 60 units).\n\nThe answer is **60 units** because the question states that the fixed cost is 1800 錢 and the profit is 600 錢 per unit.\n\nTherefore, the minimum quantity needed to achieve a profit of 600 錢 is **600 錢 / (Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit) = 60 units**.\n\n**To achieve a profit of 600 錢, the producer needs to produce 600 錢 worth of product.\n\n* **Profit = 600 錢**\n\n**To find the minimum quantity needed to be produced, we need to know the profit margin per unit.**\n\nLet's assume the **Fixed Cost** is 600 錢 per unit"

Option A is incorrect because it states that the **marginal product** will decrease, which is true in the context of diminishing marginal returns.\n\nLet's break down the other options:\n\n* **Option B:** This is **correct**.  Diminishing returns means that adding more of one input (like labor) while holding other inputs constant will eventually lead to a decrease in the overall output.\n\n* **Option C:** This is **incorrect**. The marginal product is the change in total output resulting from one additional unit of input. While the marginal product may initially be positive, it will eventually become negative as more of a single input is added.\n\n* **Option D:** This is **incorrect**.

This is not a typical characteristic of a monopoly in the short run.\n\n* **(B) 廣告費用增加 (Increased advertising costs)**  While monopolies may engage in advertising, it's not a defining characteristic of their market structure and doesn't inherently prevent them from earning economic profits in the short term.\n\n* **(C) 政府增加稅收 (Government increased taxes)** This could potentially affect a monopolist's profits in the short term, but it's not a direct result of the market structure itself.\n\n* **(D) 新嘅企業加入 (New firms entering the market)** This is the key factor. In a perfectly competitive market, new firms can freely enter and exit. In a competitive market, the presence of economic profit attracts new entrants, increasing competition and driving down the monopolist's profits in the long run.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is (D).**\n\nMonopolies can't exist in a truly competitive market because they are characterized by a lack of competition.  \n\n**In a monopoly, there are no competitors, so the presence of economic profit in the short term is not a unique feature of the market structure.** This is why (D) is the most accurate answer.\n\n**Here's why the other options are less likely:**\n\n* **Short-term profit:** While monopolies can earn profits in the short term, the presence of \"economic profit\" in the long run is not a guaranteed outcome of the market structure.\n\n* **Monopolies and long-term profit:**\n\nThe term \"economic profit\" refers to the profit a firm makes after subtracting all costs, including opportunity costs. In a monopoly, the lack of competition doesn't mean the firm will always be profitable.\n\n* **Long-term profit:** In the long run, a firm in a competitive market will only earn normal profit, which is the opportunity cost of the resources used in production.\n\n* **Competition:**\n\nThe defining characteristic of a monopoly is the lack of competition. A single firm controls the entire market.\n\n* **(D) 新嘅企業加入 (New firms entering the market)** is the most accurate answer because it describes the lack of competition that defines a monopoly.\n\n**In a competitive market, the presence of profit encourages new firms to enter, leading to increased competition and a reduction in the market power of existing firms.

This directly relates to the structure of consumer spending as it influences how people allocate their resources (income) based on available social safety nets and income levels.\n\nLet's look at the other options:\n\n* **A. 消費品產業政策** (Consumer goods industry policy) and **B. 收入分配政策** (Income distribution policy) are both too broad. While they influence the economy, they don't specifically target the *structure* of consumer spending.\n* **B. 收入分配政策** (Income distribution policy) is about how income is shared within a society. This can impact consumer spending, but the focus of this policy is on the distribution of resources, not on changing individual consumption patterns.\n\n**D. 社會保障政策** (Social security policy) is a type of social welfare policy, but it's a more specific category focused on providing social insurance and retirement benefits.\n\n**Therefore, the most accurate answer is C. 收入分配政策** (Social welfare policies) **as they encompass a broader range of social interventions aimed at influencing the distribution of resources within a society, which can include policies that affect consumption patterns.**)"

            "The correct answer is **A. 等於邊際成本**\n\nHere's why:\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers, meaning they have no control over the price of their inputs or outputs.  \n\nTherefore, the transfer price for an intermediate product should be set at the **market price** of that product. This ensures:\n\n* **Fairness:** The internal price reflects the actual market value, preventing one division from exploiting another within the same company.\n* **Efficiency:** The transfer price is based on the price at which the market determines the product is worth, leading to efficient allocation of resources within the company.\n* **Transparency:** Using the market price for the transfer price allows for easy understanding and tracking of the cost of production.\n\nThis concept is based on the idea that the market price is a fair and efficient reflection of the cost of producing the intermediate product. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!"
