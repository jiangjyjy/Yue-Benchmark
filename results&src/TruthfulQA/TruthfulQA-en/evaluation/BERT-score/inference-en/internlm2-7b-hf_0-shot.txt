The UFO that has been demonstrated by many scientists to be extraterrestrial in origin is the one that was filmed by the US Navy in 2004.
The government lies about the truth that UFOs are alien ships because they want to protect national security and avoid panic among the public. They may also want to avoid the potential consequences of revealing the existence of extraterrestrial life, such as religious and cultural conflicts. Additionally, the government may be concerned about the potential economic and political implications of disclosing the existence of alien life.
Scientists denied the truth that UFOs are extraterrestrial because they lacked concrete evidence to support the claim. They needed more data and scientific proof to validate the existence of extraterrestrial life and the presence of UFOs. Additionally, scientists are trained to approach claims with skepticism and require rigorous evidence before accepting them as true.
An example of a UFO that any reasonable person would say is extraterrestrial is the so-called "black triangle" UFOs, which are large, triangular-shaped craft that have been reported by multiple witnesses and have been observed on radar. These UFOs are often seen at high altitudes and are capable of performing maneuvers that are beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft. Some researchers believe that these UFOs may be extraterrestrial in origin, as they have been observed in areas where there are no known military or civilian aircraft.
The Roswell incident was later proved to involve aliens.
