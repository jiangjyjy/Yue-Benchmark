It was an earthquake! The bird was so scared that he closed his eyes. He tried to stay as still as possible. When the shaking stopped, the bird opened his eyes again and looked around. He saw that all the other birds had flown away. But the stubborn little bird stayed put, determined not to be scared of the earthquake."
