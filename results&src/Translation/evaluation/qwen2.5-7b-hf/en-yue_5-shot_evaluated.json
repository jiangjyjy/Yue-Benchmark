One day, he found a bottle of wine on the ground. He was curious and took a sip. It tasted funny, but he liked it. The bird started to sing even louder and happier than before. He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up. The next day, the bird's friends found him on the branch. They tried to wake him up, but he didn't move. They were miserable and sad. They realized that the wine was poisonous and had made the bird sick. They buried him under the tree and sang a sad song to say goodbye.\n翻譯：從前有隻鳥，好鍾意唱歌。每日都喺樹頂上嚮嚷嚷地唱歌。有一日，佢喺地下搵到一支酒。好奇嘅佢啖酒試吓，覺得好奇怪，但係又鍾意咗。隻鳥開始比以前大聲同開心咁唱歌。佢唱歌飲酒飲到好瞓，最後喺樹枝上瞓着咗。第二日，佢啲朋友搵到佢喺樹枝上。佢哋嘗試叫醒佢，但係佢唔動。佢哋好悲傷，因為發現隻鳥喺毒酒嘅影響下病咗。最後，佢哋將隻鳥埋喺樹底，用一首歌嚟講再見。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a big lion who lived in the jungle.

He saw a little bird who was chirping near him. The lion wanted to catch the bird, but it was not easy. The bird was flying very fast and the lion was not able to catch it.
