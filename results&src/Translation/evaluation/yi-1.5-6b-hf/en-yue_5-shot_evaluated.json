Soon, the bear was at the top. He sat at the top of the tower and looked around. He could see many things like trees and houses. But he was tired after all the climbing and so he decided to take a nap. When the bear woke up, he clambered back down the tower. He had had a lot of fun joining the tower. He was a little tired after his adventures, but he was happy.\n翻譯：從前有一隻熊，佢好攰，所以佢搵緊一個地方休息。佢見到一個金屬嘅圍欄，決定加入佢。佢抱住個圍欄，很快就入睡了。太陽照耀住，熊醒咗嚟。佢見到一個好高嘅金屬塔。佢諗起好玩，想加入佢。熊跳起上嚟，爬上塔頂。很快，熊就到達塔頂。佢坐喺塔頂，周圍睇。佢可以見到好多嘢，好似樹同埋屋。但係爬完塔後，佢好攰，所以決定瞓一陣。熊醒咗嚟，就爬返落塔。佢好開心可以加入塔，雖然冒險完後有啲攰，但係佢好快樂。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nToday, dad drove the car.

The white rabbit was so happy; it hopped and hopped in circles. The rabbit found some more food, a few nuts, and it scattered them away, far away from its home. It then hopped to a different place and scattered some more food. The rabbit was very busy today. When night came, the rabbit scampered back to its home. All the food was scattered and the rabbit was ready for a long rest. It had a full stomach, and a cozy home for bed. The white rabbit was very satisfied with its day.\n翻譯：今日，隻白兔喺度跳跳紮。佢搵到啲食物，啲莓莓，佢散落喺佢個洞附近。佢想留啲食物俾以後食。隻白兔好開心，喺度跳跳紮，跳埋一圈圈。兔仔搵到多啲食物，啲嗰果，佢散落喺遠離佢個家嘅地方。然後佢跳去另一個地方，再散多啲食物。隻兔仔今日好忙喎。夜嚟到嗰陣，隻兔仔急急返屋企。啲食物散咗晒，隻兔仔準備好好好瞓一陣。佢食咗好多，個肚腩腩，有個溫暖嘅屋企瞓，隻白兔對今日嘅表現好滿意。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce there was a little white rabbit named Ted. He was very small and liked to play with his friends in the meadow. One day he wanted to explore, so he hopped away from the meadow. He came to a big tree that was shaking and making a loud noise. Ted was so scared that his whole body trembled. Suddenly an x-ray came out of the tree and said it was a monster. Ted felt guilty because he had wandered away from the meadow.  The x-ray told Ted it was alright and that he could go back home. Ted was so relieved, then he hopped back to the meadow. He never felt so happy, and he learned his lesson to never go too far away.\n翻譯：以前有隻名叫 Ted 嘅小白兔。佢好細個，好鍾意喺草地同佢嘅朋友玩。一日，佢想探索吓，就跳離咗草地。佢嚟到一棵大樹到，個大樹喺度震，發緊大聲。 Ted 好驚，成個人震咗起上嚟。突然間，一張 X光從樹到喺度，話個大樹係一隻怪物。 Ted 好內疚，因為佢走咗離草地。張 X光安慰 Ted ，話佢可以返屋企。 Ted 好開心，就跳返去草地。佢從來未試過咁開心，佢學懂咗唔好走得太遠嘅教訓。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a noisy jungle. The birds chirped loudly and the monkeys hollered from the trees. One day, a leopard came to the jungle. He was very big and had lots of spots. He roared loudly and scared all the animals.  The leopard was very hungry and wanted to eat something. He saw a little rabbit and chased it. The rabbit ran and ran, but the leopard was too fast. The leopard caught the rabbit and ate it all up.  The other animals wept and wept. They were sad that the leopard had eaten their friend. They wished the leopard had never come to their jungle. The end.\n翻譯：從前有一片嘈吵嘅叢林。隻鳥喺度喳喳叫，隻猴子喺樹頂度大叫。一日，隻花豹嚟到呢度。佢好大隻，又多斑點。佢大叫一聲，嚇親成片叢林嘅動物。隻花豹好餓，想食啲嘢。佢見到隻小兔，就追住佢。隻兔子跑呀跑，但係隻花豹太快喇。最後，隻花豹捉到隻兔子，食咗佢。其他動物喊得好慘。佢哋好唔開心隻花豹食咗佢哋嘅朋友。佢哋希望隻花豹從來唔使嚟過呢片叢林。故事就咁結束喇。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time there was a big, strong bear. The bear had a nice cabin all by himself. He was always content in it. One day, the bear went on a walk in the woods. Suddenly, he heard a noise from a nearby bush. He went to investigate and saw a small rabbit complaining. \"What's wrong?\" asked the bear. \"My home is too small,\" said the rabbit. The bear thought for a moment. \"Would you like to live in my big cabin?\" he asked. The rabbit's eyes lit up. \"Yes!\" The bear and the rabbit went back to the bear's cabin and the rabbit moved in. Since then, the bear and the rabbit have been very happy in their big cabin.\n翻譯：從前有一隻大熊，佢好強壯，有自己一間舒適嘅木屋。熊一直都好滿意佢嘅生活。有一日，熊喺森林度行路，突然聽到附近嘅灌木叢有聲音。熊去調查下，見到一隻小兔喺度抱怨。「發生咗咩事呀？」熊問。「我間屋好細，我想搵一間大啲嘅。」兔說。熊諗咗一陣，然後問：「你想唔想嚟我間大木屋住呀？」兔嘅眼睛即刻亮咗起嚟。「想！」熊同兔一齊返到熊嘅木屋，兔就搬咗入去。從嗰日起，熊同兔喺佢哋間大木屋度過咗好幸福嘅生活。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce there was a parrot. He was hungry. He was flying around looking for food, but he couldn't find anything. Then he remembered he had buried some food in the garden. He flew down to the garden and started digging.

Now, the parrot had some food to eat when he was hungry.\n翻譯：以前有隻鹹水鳳，好餓。佢飛來飛去搵食，但係搵唔到嘢食。跟住佢記得自己埋咗啲嘢食喺花園度。佢飛落花園開始挖。很快就搵到自己嘅嘢食，佢好開心。佢食晒啲嘢。跟住佢食到好滿，決定埋啲嘢食俾將來食。佢將啲嘢食放入一個細洞度，用泥覆蓋返。而家，鹹水鳳有嘢食俾自己食嘅時候食。\n\n\n根據上面嘅例子，請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce there was a rabbit.

The wolf said \"I know a lot of things, but sorting toys is not one of them. I'm an ignorant wolf, I'm sorry.\" The girl smiled and said \"It's OK, I can do it myself.\" So she took her time to sort her toys. She was soon done and thanked the wolf for trying to help.

He cuddled up next to the fence and was soon sound asleep. The sun shone brightly and the bear woke up. He saw a very tall metal tower. He thought it looked very fun and he wanted to join it. He jumped up and climbed up the tower. Soon, the bear was at the top. He sat at the top of the tower and looked around. He could see many things like trees and houses. But he was tired after all the climbing and so he decided to take a nap. When the bear woke up, he clambered back down the tower. He had had a lot of fun joining the tower. He was a little tired after his adventures, but he was happy.\n翻譯：從前有一隻熊，佢好攰，所以佢搵緊一個地方休息。佢見到一個金屬嘅圍欄，決定加入佢。佢抱住個圍欄，很快就入睡了。太陽照耀住，熊醒咗嚟。佢見到一個好高嘅金屬塔。佢諗起好玩，想加入佢。熊跳起上嚟，爬上塔頂。很快，熊就到達塔頂。佢坐喺塔頂，周圍睇。佢可以見到好多嘢，好似樹同埋屋。但係爬完塔後，佢好攰，所以決定瞓一陣。熊醒咗嚟，就爬返落塔。佢好開心可以加入塔，雖然冒險完後有啲攰，但係佢好快樂。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce there was a grumpy bear who lived in a big cave.

He performed with the chain until he was too tired to continue. The bear had so much fun that day; he was not grumpy anymore! He went to sleep with a huge smile on his face.\n翻譯：以前有一隻好唔開心嘅熊，喺一個大洞穴度生活。有一日，熊嘅心情特別差，所以佢決定去搵啲嘢嚟開心下。佢搵到一條好長嘅鏈。熊決定用條鏈嚟表演，因為佢知係會令佢開心啲。佢笑咗，又叫咗，仲喺自己身體周圍扭埋條鏈。熊笑得開心，又將條鏈飛上佢個頭頂同後面。佢表演咗好耐，直到疲倦到唔係得再繼續。熊嗰日玩得好開心，已經唔係得再唔開心喇！佢喺好大嘅笑容下入咗睡。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a brilliant lawyer.

The little girl went home and never explored the world again.\n翻譯：從前有個小女孩，佢好想探索世界。有一日，佢見到一座大樓，好似好脆弱咁，好想近啲睇吓。所以佢開始弓起身子，希望係安全嘅。佢越行越近，直到大樓開始移動！佢好驚，但係已經太遲喇。大樓開始倒塌。個女孩好悲傷，佢唔信自己眼前嘅所見。大樓太脆弱喇，喺佢面前嘅瞬間崩塌咗。佢冇咩可以做。個小女孩返咗屋企，再冇探索世界嘅念頭。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOne day, two friends went to the park.

One friend stood with his arms around the fence, while the other was a few steps away. The first friend started to laugh as he won, but the other friend felt very bitter. He had wanted to win the race and felt upset. When the friends hugged each other goodbye, they weren't mad at each other anymore. They had a fun time racing and they wanted to do it again soon!\n翻譯：兩朋友一日去咗公園玩，玩得好開心，又大聲講笑。突然間，佢哋決定比賽跑步！兩朋友喺公園到嚟回回走，先到公園尾嘅圍欄嘅朋友就贏。其中一個朋友喺圍欄到靠一靠，而另一個朋友就喺幾步之遙嘅地方。第一個朋友贏咗就開始大笑，但係另一個朋友就好苦惱。佢原本想贏嘅，所以好唔開心。朋友哋擁抱再見嗰陣，已經冇咗啲唔開心嘅情緒。佢哋比賽嘅時候好開心，希望可以快啲再比賽過！\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time there was a strong man. He laughed all day long.  One day, he found a special ornament. He held it tight in his hand and laughed even louder. He was so happy to own an ornament so beautiful.  He held it up to the sun and the sparkles made him laugh even harder. He laughed until his sides hurt. He took the ornament everywhere with him. He was so proud and laughed every time he looked at it. But one day, a gust of wind came and blew the ornament away. He laughed because it was a funny sight, watching the ornament fly away.  He ran after it, but he could not catch it. Instead, he laughed and said goodbye. He knew that the ornament had a grand adventure to go on.\n翻譯：從前有個好勁嘅人，佢成日都笑到停唔到口。有一日，佢搵到一個特別嘅裝飾品。佢好緊握住佢，笑得更響。佢好開心可以擁有咁靚嘅裝飾品。佢將裝飾品舉高，面對太陽，啲閃光令佢笑得更勁。笑到個肚都痛埋。佢帶住個裝飾品去到處，好自豪，每次望到佢都笑。但係有一日，一陣風嚟到，吹走咗個裝飾品。佢笑咗，因為見到個裝飾品飛走嘅樣好搞笑。佢追住個裝飾品，但係追唔上。佢就笑住講再見，佢知個裝飾品有個偉大嘅冒險等住佢。\n\n\n根據上面嘅例子，請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a delicate mushroom. It wanted to win the race, so it started running. But the mushroom was too delicate and it couldn't move fast enough. Suddenly, a big gust of wind blew it away and it couldn't get back.  The mushroom flew and flew until it reached a dark cave. The mushroom was scared and it started to cry. It wanted to go home, but it was stuck.  Soon, a big monster came in the cave. He was very angry and he grabbed the delicate mushroom. He started to eat it and the mushroom could not win.  When the monster finished eating the mushroom, he felt bad. The poor mushroom had lost the race and would never be seen again.\n",

The wallet wasn't as clean as it used to be, but the little boy liked it even more because of the long time it took him to wipe it off. The little boy learnt a valuable lesson that day: never give up, even when something takes a long time. With a bit of determination, you can achieve great things.\n翻譯：從前有個細路仔，佢有一本錢包，對佢嚟講好特別。佢鍾意帶住佢去所有地方。有一日，個細路仔出咗去，佢不小心喺泥濘嘅水坑到甩咗佢本錢包。個錢包被泥濘覆蓋，又濕又髒。但係個細路仔唔會放棄。佢用手抹走個錢包上面嘅泥，希望可以再清潔返。個錢包唔係以前咁乾淨，但係個細路仔更加鍾意佢，因為花咗好耐時間先抹得掂。個細路仔嗰日學咗一個寶貴嘅教訓：唔好放棄，即使做一件嘢要花好多時間。只要有啲決心，你可以達成偉大嘅成就。\n\n\n根據上面嘅例子，請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nAndy was an inquisitive 3 year old boy.

One day, he found a bottle of wine on the ground. He was curious and took a sip. It tasted funny, but he liked it. The bird started to sing even louder and happier than before. He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up. The next day, the bird's friends found him on the branch. They tried to wake him up, but he didn't move. They were miserable and sad. They realized that the wine was poisonous and had made the bird sick. They buried him under the tree and sang a sad song to say goodbye.\n翻譯：從前有隻鳥，好鍾意唱歌。每日都喺樹頂上嚮嚷嚷地唱歌。有一日，佢喺地下搵到一支酒。好奇嘅佢啖酒試吓，覺得好奇怪，但係又鍾意咗。隻鳥開始比以前大聲同開心咁唱歌。佢唱歌飲酒飲到好瞓，最後喺樹枝上瞓着咗。第二日，佢啲朋友搵到佢喺樹枝上。佢哋嘗試叫醒佢，但係佢唔動。佢哋好悲傷，因為發現隻鳥喺毒酒嘅影響下病咗。最後，佢哋將隻鳥埋喺樹底，用一首歌嚟講再見。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a big lion who lived in the jungle. He was very strong and brave. One day, he was feeling very sleepy and decided to take a nap. While he was sleeping, he started to blink his eyes. Suddenly, he heard a sound and woke up. He saw a little bird who was chirping near him. The lion wanted to catch the bird, but it was not easy. The bird was flying very fast and the lion was not able to catch it. The lion decided to take it easy and went back to sleep. He knew that he could catch the bird later when he was not feeling sleepy. From that day on, the lion was always careful and never slept when there were birds around.\n翻譯：從前有一隻大獅子喺叢林度生活。佢好強大同勇敢。一日，佢好想睡覺，決定瞓一陣。而佢瞓緊覺嗰陣，開始眨眼。突然間，佢聽到一聲響，就醒咗。佢見到一隻細細嘅雀，喺佢附近喺度喳喳叫。獅子想捉隻雀，但係唔係好易。隻雀飛得好快，獅子捉唔到佢。獅子決定放鬆啲，返去瞓覺。佢知係可以喺唔咁瞓覺嗰陣捉到隻雀嘅。從嗰日開始，獅子一直都好小心，當有雀嘅時候都唔會瞓覺。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a clever little bird. He lived in a tree near a big house with a porch. One day, the little bird saw a cat trying to catch a mouse on the porch. The cat was very mean and the mouse was very scared.  The clever little bird knew he had to help. He flew down and yelled at the cat, \"Stop! Leave the mouse alone!\" The cat was surprised and ran away. The mouse was very grateful to the clever little bird.  The moral of the story is that even though we are small, we can still make a big difference by being brave and helping others.\n翻譯：從前有隻聰明嘅小鳥，佢喺一棵樹上住，而棵樹就喺一棟有露台嘅大屋旁邊。一日，小鳥見到隻貓喺露台度想捉隻老鼠。隻貓好惡毒，而隻老鼠就好驚。隻聰明嘅小鳥知道自己要出手相救。佢飛落嚟，大叫住隻貓，「停！唔好再煩老鼠喇！」隻貓被嚇親，走咗去。隻老鼠好感激隻聰明嘅小鳥。呢個故事嘅道理就係，即使我哋好細，但係如果我哋勇於幫助他人，都係可以帶來大嘅改變嘅。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was an enormous tree. It was very old. It lived in a big forest. Many animals lived near the tree. They liked to play and talk around it. One day, a little bunny went to the tree. He saw a big bird on a branch. The bunny said, \"Hello, bird! Let's go play!\" The bird looked at the bunny and said, \"Okay, let's go!\" So, the bunny and the bird went to play. They ran and jumped and laughed.

He drove fast and the car zoomed down the street. Dad smiled as he drove and felt free. But then he saw something fragile on the road. He quickly hit the brakes, and the car stopped.

He put the bird on his arm and drove the car more slowly. He drove the bird home and put it on a fluffy pillow. The little robin looked around and smiled. Dad and the bird had become friends today!\n翻譯：今日，阿爸開車。佢開得好快，架車喺街度飛馳。阿爸開車嗰陣好開心，覺得好自由。但係佢突然見到有啲嘢喺路度好脆弱。佢立即踩剎車，架車就停低咗。阿爸落車攞咗個脆弱嘅嘢上嚟。原來係隻小鳥！阿爸好溫柔咁對待隻小鳥。佢將隻鳥放在佢隻膊頭度，然後慢啲開車。佢帶隻鳥返屋企，放喺隻好柔軟嘅枕頭度。隻小鳥周圍望下，好似笑咁。阿爸同隻鳥今日成為咗好朋友！\n\n\n根據上面嘅例子，請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce there was a stubborn little bird.
