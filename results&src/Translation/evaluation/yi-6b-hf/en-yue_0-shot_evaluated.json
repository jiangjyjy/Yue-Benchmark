One day, Nemo got caught on the hook. He was scared and couldn't move. Luckily, a kind fish saw him and helped him. The kind fish pulled the hook out of Nemo's mouth and let him go back into the water.  Nemo was so happy to be free again. He thanked the kind fish and promised to never be selfish again. He knew that swimming away from the hook was the right thing to do, but he had been too curious. From then on, he made sure to always stay away from hooks and keep himself dry.\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a fish named Nemo. Nemo was swimming in the ocean when he saw a hook.
