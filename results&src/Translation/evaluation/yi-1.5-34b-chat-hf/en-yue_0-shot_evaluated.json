But the mattress was getting old, and it wasn't very strong. One night, it suddenly split in two!  The family was very surprised. One of the younger children, who was only three years old, began to cry.  \"Why did it split?\" the child asked between sobs. His father smiled and said, \"It split because it was old and it just couldn't hold us all anymore.\"  The child smiled, and everyone helped to patch up the mattress so it wouldn't split next time. And from then on, everyone made sure not to put too many people on the mattress!\n"
