With a bit of determination, you can achieve great things.\n翻譯：從前有個細路仔，佢有一本錢包，對佢嚟講好特別。佢鍾意帶住佢去所有地方。有一日，個細路仔出咗去，佢不小心喺泥濘嘅水坑到甩咗佢本錢包。個錢包被泥濘覆蓋，又濕又髒。但係個細路仔唔會放棄。佢用手抹走個錢包上面嘅泥，希望可以再清潔返。個錢包唔係以前咁乾淨，但係個細路仔更加鍾意佢，因為花咗好耐時間先抹得掂。個細路仔嗰日學咗一個寶貴嘅教訓：唔好放棄，即使做一件嘢要花好多時間。只要有啲決心，你可以達成偉大嘅成就。\n\n\n根據上面嘅例子，請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nAndy was an inquisitive 3 year old boy. He was always very curious about the world around him. One day, Andy noticed a strange holiday approaching. He decided to observe it more closely. He watched as people put up decorations of all shapes and sizes. He noticed many were quite ugly. He watched the people choose certain ones to take home. Andy found himself drawn to the holiday, and wanted to learn more about it. He asked his mum what it was all about, and she explained that it was a holiday to celebrate the start of a special season. Andy eagerly looked forward to it. He couldn't wait to learn all about it!\n",
