John went to the forest and searched for the treasure. He looked everywhere but he couldn't find it. As he was walking home, he saw a group of mean boys. They took John's toys and ran away. John was very sad because he lost his toys and didn't find the treasure.  From that day on, John remembered to always be careful and not trust strangers. He also learned that sometimes things don't always turn out the way we want them to.\n"
