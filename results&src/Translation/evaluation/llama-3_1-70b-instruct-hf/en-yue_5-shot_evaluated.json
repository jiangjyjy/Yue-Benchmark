John was very generous and always shared his toys with his friends. One day, John found a note on the ground. The note said that there was a treasure hidden in the forest. John remembered that he had seen the note before and decided to go find the treasure.  John went to the forest and searched for the treasure. He looked everywhere but he couldn't find it. As he was walking home, he saw a group of mean boys. They took John's toys and ran away. John was very sad because he lost his toys and didn't find the treasure.  From that day on, John remembered to always be careful and not trust strangers. He also learned that sometimes things don't always turn out the way we want them to.\n翻譯：從前有個好好嘅人叫約翰。約翰好慷慨，成日同朋友分享佢嘅玩具。有一日，約翰喺地底下搵到一張紙。張紙寫住有寶藏隱藏喺森林入面。約翰記得佢之前見過張紙，決定去搵寶藏。約翰去咗森林搵寶藏。佢四圍搵，但係搵唔到。當佢行返屋企嗰陣，見到一群惡劣嘅小朋友。佢哋攞咗約翰嘅玩具就走咗。約翰好唔開心，因為佢唔單止失咗玩具，仲冇搵到寶藏。從嗰日開始，約翰記住要小心啲，唔好信陌生人。佢亦都學懂咗啲嘢唔會總係按計劃進行。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time there was a boy.

Suddenly an x-ray came out of the tree and said it was a monster. Ted felt guilty because he had wandered away from the meadow.  The x-ray told Ted it was alright and that he could go back home. Ted was so relieved, then he hopped back to the meadow. He never felt so happy, and he learned his lesson to never go too far away.\n翻譯：以前有隻名叫 Ted 嘅小白兔。佢好細個，好鍾意喺草地同佢嘅朋友玩。一日，佢想探索吓，就跳離咗草地。佢嚟到一棵大樹到，個大樹喺度震，發緊大聲。 Ted 好驚，成個人震咗起上嚟。突然間，一張 X光從樹到喺度，話個大樹係一隻怪物。 Ted 好內疚，因為佢走咗離草地。張 X光安慰 Ted ，話佢可以返屋企。 Ted 好開心，就跳返去草地。佢從來未試過咁開心，佢學懂咗唔好走得太遠嘅教訓。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time there was a big, bright net.
