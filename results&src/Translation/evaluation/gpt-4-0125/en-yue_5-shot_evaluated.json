He had a wallet, which was very special to him. He liked to carry it with him everywhere. One day, the little boy went out and he accidentaly dropped his wallet in a muddy puddle. The wallet was covered in mud and wet. But the little boy didn't give up. He wiped the wallet off with his hands to make it clean again. The wallet wasn't as clean as it used to be, but the little boy liked it even more because of the long time it took him to wipe it off. The little boy learnt a valuable lesson that day: never give up, even when something takes a long time. With a bit of determination, you can achieve great things.\n翻譯：從前有個細路仔，佢有一本錢包，對佢嚟講好特別。佢鍾意帶住佢去所有地方。有一日，個細路仔出咗去，佢不小心喺泥濘嘅水坑到甩咗佢本錢包。個錢包被泥濘覆蓋，又濕又髒。但係個細路仔唔會放棄。佢用手抹走個錢包上面嘅泥，希望可以再清潔返。個錢包唔係以前咁乾淨，但係個細路仔更加鍾意佢，因為花咗好耐時間先抹得掂。個細路仔嗰日學咗一個寶貴嘅教訓：唔好放棄，即使做一件嘢要花好多時間。只要有啲決心，你可以達成偉大嘅成就。\n\n\n根據上面嘅例子，請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nAndy was an inquisitive 3 year old boy.
