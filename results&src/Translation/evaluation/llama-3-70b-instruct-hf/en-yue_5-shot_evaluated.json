It was hung between two tall trees in a sunny park. One day, a little black bird was flying in the park when it got caught in the net! The bird panicked and started to flutter around, but it just could not get away. Just then, a friendly bear came walking along. He saw the poor bird struggling and immediately knew what to do. He carefully pulled the net away from the trees and the bird flew up in the air and away. The bird was so happy and flew off to find a new place to make its home. The bear smiled as he watched the bird fly away and waved goodbye.
