The wolf noticed her and said \"Don't be afraid, I'm here to help you.\" The girl didn't understand why the wolf wanted to help but decided to trust him. She asked the wolf to help her sort her toys. The wolf said \"I know a lot of things, but sorting toys is not one of them. I'm an ignorant wolf, I'm sorry.\" The girl smiled and said \"It's OK, I can do it myself.\" So she took her time to sort her toys. She was soon done and thanked the wolf for trying to help. The wolf walked away feeling happy and proud.\n"

His father smiled and said, \"It split because it was old and it just couldn't hold us all anymore.\"  The child smiled, and everyone helped to patch up the mattress so it wouldn't split next time.
