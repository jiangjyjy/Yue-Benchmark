She loved to play with her dolls and wear pretty dresses. One day, Lily's mommy put some makeup on her face. Lily didn't like it because it felt heavy on her skin. She told her mommy that she hated the makeup. Later that day, Lily went outside to play with her friends. She forgot all about the makeup and had lots of fun. When she came back inside, her mommy helped her wash the makeup off her face. Lily felt much better without it. From then on, she decided she didn't like heavy makeup and would only wear a little bit when she was older. The end.\n",

The mushroom flew and flew until it reached a dark cave. The mushroom was scared and it started to cry. It wanted to go home, but it was stuck.  Soon, a big monster came in the cave. He was very angry and he grabbed the delicate mushroom. He started to eat it and the mushroom could not win.  When the monster finished eating the mushroom, he felt bad. The poor mushroom had lost the race and would never be seen again.\n",
