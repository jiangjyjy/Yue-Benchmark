The bird started to sing even louder and happier than before. He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up. The next day, the bird's friends found him on the branch. They tried to wake him up, but he didn't move. They were miserable and sad. They realized that the wine was poisonous and had made the bird sick. They buried him under the tree and sang a sad song to say goodbye.\n",

Soon there were only some ashes left in the fire. Mum and Dad were relieved. The frog was gone, but they were both anxious. Would the fire be too big? Would they be able to put it out in time before it burned everything? They watched as the fire slowly died down. When it was safe, they went to bed feeling relieved.\n",
