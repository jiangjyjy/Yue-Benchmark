He took it to the kitchen and put it in the oven, and all day long it smelled of pumpkin. Finally, the farmer took it out of the oven and presented it to the family.

He stopped and looked around to see what it was. He saw something brown in the grass. It was a mask! John bent down to pick it up. He felt the soft fabric and saw the interesting design. He heard the noise again and saw that it was coming from the mask. John put the mask on and the noise stopped. He felt excited and happy. He decided to keep it with him on his walk. John made his way down the street, the brown mask on his face. Every now and then, he heard the noise again, but it made him smile. He was happy to have found the mask.\n",
