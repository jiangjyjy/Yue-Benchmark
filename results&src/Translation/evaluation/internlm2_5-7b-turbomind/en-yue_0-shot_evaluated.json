      "Once upon a time, there was a grumpy bear who lived in a big cave. One day, the bear was so grumpy that he went to find something to cheer him up. He found a long chain. The bear decided to perform with the chain because he knew it would make him happy. He laughed and cheered as he twisted and turned the chain around his body. The bear smiled and laughed and made the chain fly over his head and behind his back. He performed with the chain until he was too tired to continue. The bear had so much fun that day; he was not grumpy anymore! He went to sleep with a huge smile on his face.\n\n粵語翻譯：\n古時古時，有隻暴躁熊住在一個大山洞。一日，熊咁暴躁，佢去搵嘢嚟令自己高興。佢搵到一條長鏈。熊决定用呢條鏈嚟表演，因为佢知啲表演會令佢高興。佢笑哂哂，哂哂，扭住啲鏈，用佢身体扭住啲鏈。熊笑哂哂，哂哂，把啲鏈甩过佢頭上，甩到佢背後。佢用啲鏈表演到佢太疲倦而停唔住。熊嗰日嚟玩咁高興，佢唔再暴躁。佢上床睡觉，面容上嚟个大笑。"

They walked through the park and saw many pretty flowers.  Suddenly, Lily saw a dangerous snake on the path. Her mommy told her to stay back and not get too close. The snake slithered away and they continued on their walk.  As they walked, Lily saw a butterfly and started to follow it. She led her mommy to a beautiful garden with lots of flowers.
