He laughed all day long.  One day, he found a special ornament. He held it tight in his hand and laughed even louder. He was so happy to own an ornament so beautiful.  He held it up to the sun and the sparkles made him laugh even harder. He laughed until his sides hurt. He took the ornament everywhere with him. He was so proud and laughed every time he looked at it. But one day, a gust of wind came and blew the ornament away. He laughed because it was a funny sight, watching the ornament fly away.  He ran after it, but he could not catch it. Instead, he laughed and said goodbye. He knew that the ornament had a grand adventure to go on.\n",

The sun shone brightly and the bear woke up. He saw a very tall metal tower. He thought it looked very fun and he wanted to join it. He jumped up and climbed up the tower. Soon, the bear was at the top. He sat at the top of the tower and looked around. He could see many things like trees and houses. But he was tired after all the climbing and so he decided to take a nap. When the bear woke up, he clambered back down the tower. He had had a lot of fun joining the tower.

She looked around and realized she was all alone. The lonely little girl rode far away from the cherry trees. After a while, she became less lonely and came back to pick more cherries. She was so happy and smiled as she rode away. The end.\n",

One day, he found a bottle of wine on the ground. He was curious and took a sip. It tasted funny, but he liked it. The bird started to sing even louder and happier than before. He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up. The next day, the bird's friends found him on the branch. They tried to wake him up, but he didn't move. They were miserable and sad. They realized that the wine was poisonous and had made the bird sick. They buried him under the tree and sang a sad song to say goodbye.\n翻譯：從前有隻鳥，好鍾意唱歌。每日都喺樹頂上嚮嚷嚷地唱歌。有一日，佢喺地下搵到一支酒。好奇嘅佢啖酒試吓，覺得好奇怪，但係又鍾意咗。隻鳥開始比以前大聲同開心咁唱歌。佢唱歌飲酒飲到好瞓，最後喺樹枝上瞓着咗。第二日，佢啲朋友搵到佢喺樹枝上。佢哋嘗試叫醒佢，但係佢唔動。佢哋好悲傷，因為發現隻鳥喺毒酒嘅影響下病咗。最後，佢哋將隻鳥埋喺樹底，用一首歌嚟講再見。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a big lion who lived in the jungle. He was very strong and brave. One day, he was feeling very sleepy and decided to take a nap. While he was sleeping, he started to blink his eyes. Suddenly, he heard a sound and woke up. He saw a little bird who was chirping near him. The lion wanted to catch the bird, but it was not easy. The bird was flying very fast and the lion was not able to catch it. The lion decided to take it easy and went back to sleep. He knew that he could catch the bird later when he was not feeling sleepy. From that day on, the lion was always careful and never slept when there were birds around.\n翻譯：從前有一隻大獅子喺叢林度生活。佢好強大同勇敢。一日，佢好想睡覺，決定瞓一陣。而佢瞓緊覺嗰陣，開始眨眼。突然間，佢聽到一聲響，就醒咗。佢見到一隻細細嘅雀，喺佢附近喺度喳喳叫。獅子想捉隻雀，但係唔係好易。隻雀飛得好快，獅子捉唔到佢。獅子決定放鬆啲，返去瞓覺。佢知係可以喺唔咁瞓覺嗰陣捉到隻雀嘅。從嗰日開始，獅子一直都好小心，當有雀嘅時候都唔會瞓覺。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a clever little bird.
