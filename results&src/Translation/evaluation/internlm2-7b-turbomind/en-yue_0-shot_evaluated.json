That means not putting too much on and looking natural. Lucy didn't understand at first, but her mommy showed her how to use just a little bit of makeup to make her cheeks rosy and her lips pink. From then on, Lucy always made sure to be modest with her makeup. She would get ready for the day by putting on just a little bit of lipstick and blush, and she looked beautiful.
