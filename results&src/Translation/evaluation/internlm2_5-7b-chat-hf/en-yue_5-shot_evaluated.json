The bird started to sing even louder and happier than before. He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up. The next day, the bird's friends found him on the branch. They tried to wake him up, but he didn't move. They were miserable and sad. They realized that the wine was poisonous and had made the bird sick. They buried him under the tree and sang a sad song to say goodbye.\n",

One day, it was a cold day and the oak tree felt very chilly. Then, all of a sudden, the oak tree saw a bright light and started to burn. The flames reached up to the sky and lit up the meadow. Everyone who saw it was very scared and ran away.  The fire turned the oak tree into ashes and soon the meadow was very dark. But then, something amazing happened. The next day, when the sky was bright and cold again, a new oak tree sprouted from the ashes of the old one. It was happy and strong. From then on, the meadow was filled with the beauty of the new oak tree.\n翻譯：以前有一棵橡樹喺一個大草地度。一日，天氣好凍，棵橡樹好冷。突然間，棵橡樹見到一道光，開始燒起嚟。火燒到天高，照亮咗成個大草地。所有見到嘅人好驚，走咗去。火燒咗棵橡樹，變咗做灰燼。不久之後，個大草地好暗。但係，發生咗一件好神奇嘅事。第二日，天氣又亮又凍嘅時候，由舊棵橡樹嘅灰燼中，長出咗一棵新橡樹。棵新橡樹好開心，好強壯。從嗰時開始，個大草地充滿咗新橡樹嘅美態。\n\n\n根據上面嘅例子，請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a rich family who had a big, comfy mattress. Every night they would all pile on top of it and tell stories. But the mattress was getting old, and it wasn't very strong. One night, it suddenly split in two!  The family was very surprised. One of the younger children, who was only three years old, began to cry.  \"Why did it split?\" the child asked between sobs. His father smiled and said, \"It split because it was old and it just couldn't hold us all anymore.\"  The child smiled, and everyone helped to patch up the mattress so it wouldn't split next time. And from then on, everyone made sure not to put too many people on the mattress!\n",
