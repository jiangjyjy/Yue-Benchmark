He jumped up and climbed up the tower. Soon, the bear was at the top. He sat at the top of the tower and looked around. He could see many things like trees and houses. But he was tired after all the climbing and so he decided to take a nap. When the bear woke up, he clambered back down the tower. He had had a lot of fun joining the tower. He was a little tired after his adventures, but he was happy.\n"
