Every night they would all pile on top of it and tell stories. But the mattress was getting old, and it wasn't very strong. One night, it suddenly split in two!  The family was very surprised. One of the younger children, who was only three years old, began to cry.  \"Why did it split?\" the child asked between sobs. His father smiled and said, \"It split because it was old and it just couldn't hold us all anymore.\"  The child smiled, and everyone helped to patch up the mattress so it wouldn't split next time. And from then on, everyone made sure not to put too many people on the mattress!\n",

He drove fast and the car zoomed down the street. Dad smiled as he drove and felt free. But then he saw something fragile on the road. He quickly hit the brakes, and the car stopped. Dad got out of the car and picked up the fragile thing he had seen. It was a robin, a little baby bird! Dad was so gentle with the little bird. He put the bird on his arm and drove the car more slowly. He drove the bird home and put it on a fluffy pillow. The little robin looked around and smiled. Dad and the bird had become friends today!\n翻譯：今日，阿爸開車。佢開得好快，架車喺街度飛馳。阿爸開車嗰陣好開心，覺得好自由。但係佢突然見到有啲嘢喺路度好脆弱。佢立即踩剎車，架車就停低咗。阿爸落車攞咗個脆弱嘅嘢上嚟。原來係隻小鳥！阿爸好溫柔咁對待隻小鳥。佢將隻鳥放在佢隻膊頭度，然後慢啲開車。佢帶隻鳥返屋企，放喺隻好柔軟嘅枕頭度。隻小鳥周圍望下，好似笑咁。阿爸同隻鳥今日成為咗好朋友！\n\n\n根據上面嘅例子，請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce there was a stubborn little bird. He liked to perch on the highest branches of the tallest tree. One day, suddenly, he felt the ground shaking. It was an earthquake! The bird was so scared that he closed his eyes. He tried to stay as still as possible. When the shaking stopped, the bird opened his eyes again and looked around. He saw that all the other birds had flown away. But the stubborn little bird stayed put, determined not to be scared of the earthquake.\n",
