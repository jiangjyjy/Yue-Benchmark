The spider looked back at the pig and the pig jumped. Then the spider moved closer and the pig felt a bit scared. But he stayed still. The spider got closer and closer and the pig started to get really scared. The spider was about to bite the pig. But before it could, something made a noise in the woods. The spider ran away, scared.

One day, she wanted to sort her toys. On her way, she saw a wolf. She felt scared and started to cry. The wolf noticed her and said \"Don't be afraid, I'm here to help you.\" The girl didn't understand why the wolf wanted to help but decided to trust him. She asked the wolf to help her sort her toys. The wolf said \"I know a lot of things, but sorting toys is not one of them. I'm an ignorant wolf, I'm sorry.\" The girl smiled and said \"It's OK, I can do it myself.\" So she took her time to sort her toys. She was soon done and thanked the wolf for trying to help. The wolf walked away feeling happy and proud.\n",

John was very generous and always shared his toys with his friends. One day, John found a note on the ground. The note said that there was a treasure hidden in the forest. John remembered that he had seen the note before and decided to go find the treasure.  John went to the forest and searched for the treasure. He looked everywhere but he couldn't find it. As he was walking home, he saw a group of mean boys. They took John's toys and ran away. John was very sad because he lost his toys and didn't find the treasure.  From that day on, John remembered to always be careful and not trust strangers. He also learned that sometimes things don't always turn out the way we want them to.\n翻譯：從前有個好好嘅人叫約翰。約翰好慷慨，成日同朋友分享佢嘅玩具。有一日，約翰喺地底下搵到一張紙。張紙寫住有寶藏隱藏喺森林入面。約翰記得佢之前見過張紙，決定去搵寶藏。約翰去咗森林搵寶藏。佢四圍搵，但係搵唔到。當佢行返屋企嗰陣，見到一群惡劣嘅小朋友。佢哋攞咗約翰嘅玩具就走咗。約翰好唔開心，因為佢唔單止失咗玩具，仲冇搵到寶藏。從嗰日開始，約翰記住要小心啲，唔好信陌生人。佢亦都學懂咗啲嘢唔會總係按計劃進行。\n\n\n根據上面嘅例子，請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nJohn was walking down the street when he heard a noise. He stopped and looked around to see what it was. He saw something brown in the grass. It was a mask! John bent down to pick it up. He felt the soft fabric and saw the interesting design. He heard the noise again and saw that it was coming from the mask. John put the mask on and the noise stopped. He felt excited and happy. He decided to keep it with him on his walk. John made his way down the street, the brown mask on his face. Every now and then, he heard the noise again, but it made him smile. He was happy to have found the mask.\n",

He carefully pulled the net away from the trees and the bird flew up in the air and away. The bird was so happy and flew off to find a new place to make its home. The bear smiled as he watched the bird fly away and waved goodbye.

He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up. The next day, the bird's friends found him on the branch. They tried to wake him up, but he didn't move. They were miserable and sad. They realized that the wine was poisonous and had made the bird sick. They buried him under the tree and sang a sad song to say goodbye.\n翻譯：從前有隻鳥，好鍾意唱歌。每日都喺樹頂上嚮嚷嚷地唱歌。有一日，佢喺地下搵到一支酒。好奇嘅佢啖酒試吓，覺得好奇怪，但係又鍾意咗。隻鳥開始比以前大聲同開心咁唱歌。佢唱歌飲酒飲到好瞓，最後喺樹枝上瞓着咗。第二日，佢啲朋友搵到佢喺樹枝上。佢哋嘗試叫醒佢，但係佢唔動。佢哋好悲傷，因為發現隻鳥喺毒酒嘅影響下病咗。最後，佢哋將隻鳥埋喺樹底，用一首歌嚟講再見。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a big lion who lived in the jungle.
