The nice man behind the counter gave her a little ticket and told her to get on the train. Lucy got on the train and found a seat. There were boxes and packages all around her. Then she heard a loud noise. It was the train conductor, asking everyone to load the luggage onto the train. So Lucy got up and helped the others put their bags on the train. Soon the train was loaded, and they were ready to go! Lucy waved goodbye to everyone at the station and settled into her seat. She was ready for her adventure to begin!",

One of the younger children, who was only three years old, began to cry. \"Why did it split?\" the child asked between sobs. His father smiled and said, \"It split because it was old and it just couldn't hold us all anymore.\" The child smiled, and everyone helped to patch up the mattress so it wouldn't split next time. And from then on, everyone made sure not to put too many people on the mattress!\n\n从前，有一个富裕的家庭，他们有一张又大又舒服的床垫。每天晚上，他们都会挤在上面讲故事。但是床垫变得旧了，而且不是很坚固。一天晚上，它突然裂成了两半！这个家庭非常惊讶。其中一个年幼的孩子，只有三岁，开始哭泣。“为什么它裂开了？”孩子抽泣着问道。他的父亲微笑着说：“它裂开是因为它老了，它已经不能承受我们所有人了。”孩子笑了，大家帮忙修补床垫，这样它就不会下次再裂开。从那时起，大家确保床垫上不要放太多人。"

One day, the car saw a little bird that needed help. The bird had a broken wing and couldn't fly. The car knew it needed to help the bird.  The car drove the bird to a special place where they could fix the wing. It was a rare place where they helped animals. The bird was very happy and thanked the car. The car honked its horn to say goodbye and drove away.
