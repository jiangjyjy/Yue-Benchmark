They would play and lay in the sun, and the persistent spider was always on the lookout for a good spot to lay more eggs. The end.\n",

That means not putting too much on and looking natural. Lucy didn't understand at first, but her mommy showed her how to use just a little bit of makeup to make her cheeks rosy and her lips pink. From then on, Lucy always made sure to be modest with her makeup. She would get ready for the day by putting on just a little bit of lipstick and blush, and she looked beautiful. Her mommy was proud of her for being so grown-up and responsible. The end.\n",

The child's name was Abigail and she was three years old. Every day Abigail would go out to play in the park.  One day Abigail was at the park with her mother and her pet dog. Abigail was running around, playing tag with her dog. Suddenly, Abigail heard her mother calling her name. \"Abigail, it's time to go home,\" her mother said. Abigail was sad because she wanted to stay and play longer. Her mother asked her if she remembered the slow walk rule. Abigail nodded and began walking slowly. As they walked home, Abigail remembered how much fun she had at the park and made a promise to herself to play there again the next day.\n",

Dad and the bird had become friends today!\n翻譯：今日，阿爸開車。佢開得好快，架車喺街度飛馳。阿爸開車嗰陣好開心，覺得好自由。但係佢突然見到有啲嘢喺路度好脆弱。佢立即踩剎車，架車就停低咗。阿爸落車攞咗個脆弱嘅嘢上嚟。原來係隻小鳥！阿爸好溫柔咁對待隻小鳥。佢將隻鳥放在佢隻膊頭度，然後慢啲開車。佢帶隻鳥返屋企，放喺隻好柔軟嘅枕頭度。隻小鳥周圍望下，好似笑咁。阿爸同隻鳥今日成為咗好朋友！\n\n\n根據上面嘅例子，請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce there was a stubborn little bird. He liked to perch on the highest branches of the tallest tree. One day, suddenly, he felt the ground shaking. It was an earthquake! The bird was so scared that he closed his eyes. He tried to stay as still as possible. When the shaking stopped, the bird opened his eyes again and looked around. He saw that all the other birds had flown away. But the stubborn little bird stayed put, determined not to be scared of the earthquake.\n",

      "翻譯：從前有一隻好倔嘅小鳥。佢鍾意喺最高嘅樹枝度喺度坐。一日，突然，佢覺得地嚟震。係地震！小鳥好驚，佢瞓咗眼。佢試吓瞓啲，好似好穩。當震動停止，小鳥瞓醒咗，望住周圍。佢見到所有嘅其他鳥都飛咗走。但係個倔嘅小鳥喺度瞓，決心唔好驚地震。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a little bird. He lived in a tree near a big house with a porch. One day, the little bird saw a cat trying to catch a mouse on the porch. The cat was very mean and the mouse was very scared. The little bird knew he had to help. He flew down and yelled at the cat, \"Stop! Leave the mouse alone!\" The cat was surprised and ran away. The mouse was very grateful to the little bird. The moral of the story is that even though we are small, we can still make a big difference by being brave and helping others.\n翻譯：從前有隻小鳥，佢喺一棵樹上住，而棵樹就喺一棟有露台嘅大屋旁邊。一日，小鳥見到隻貓喺露台度想捉隻老鼠。隻貓好惡毒，而隻老鼠就好驚。隻聰明嘅小鳥知道佢要幫手。佢飛落去，叫住貓，「停！唔好捉老鼠。」隻貓吓。隻貓吓。隻貓喺度。\n"
