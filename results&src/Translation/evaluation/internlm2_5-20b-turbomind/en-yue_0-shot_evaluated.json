One of the younger children, who was only three years old, began to cry.  \"Why did it split?\" the child asked between sobs. His father smiled and said, \"It split because it was old and it just couldn't hold us all anymore.\"  The child smiled, and everyone helped to patch up the mattress so it wouldn't split next time.

      "很久很久以前，有一個善良的人叫約翰。約翰非常慷慨，總是和他的朋友分享他的玩具。有一天，約翰在地上發現了一張紙條。紙條上寫著森林裡藏著一個寶藏。約翰記得他以前見過這張紙條，於是決定去找寶藏。約翰去了森林，開始尋找寶藏。他找遍了每一個地方，但都找不到。當他回家的時候，他看到了一群壞男孩。他們拿走了約翰的玩具，然後跑掉了。約翰很傷心，因為他失去了他的玩具，而且沒有找到寶藏。從那天起，約翰記得要時時小心，不要相信陌生人。他也學到了，事情並不總是像我們希望的那樣發展。"
