He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up. The next day, the bird's friends found him on the branch.

So Timmy closed his eyes and prayed.  Suddenly, the itch disappeared! Timmy was so happy and thanked God for helping him. From that day on, Timmy learned to pray whenever he had a problem.
