Nemo was swimming in the ocean when he saw a hook. He knew that the hook was not good for him, so he swam away.  One day, Nemo got caught on the hook. He was scared and couldn't move. Luckily, a kind fish saw him and helped him. The kind fish pulled the hook out of Nemo's mouth and let him go back into the water.  Nemo was so happy to be free again. He thanked the kind fish and promised to never be selfish again. He knew that swimming away from the hook was the right thing to do, but he had been too curious. From then on, he made sure to always stay away from hooks and keep himself dry.\n",

Everyone who saw it was very scared and ran away.  The fire turned the oak tree into ashes and soon the meadow was very dark. But then, something amazing happened.

One day, he found a bottle of wine on the ground. He was curious and took a sip. It tasted funny, but he liked it. The bird started to sing even louder and happier than before. He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up. The next day, the bird's friends found him on the branch. They tried to wake him up, but he didn't move. They were miserable and sad. They realized that the wine was poisonous and had made the bird sick. They buried him under the tree and sang a sad song to say goodbye.\n翻譯：從前有隻鳥，好鍾意唱歌。每日都喺樹頂上嚮嚷嚷地唱歌。有一日，佢喺地下搵到一支酒。好奇嘅佢啖酒試吓，覺得好奇怪，但係又鍾意咗。隻鳥開始比以前大聲同開心咁唱歌。佢唱歌飲酒飲到好瞓，最後喺樹枝上瞓着咗。第二日，佢啲朋友搵到佢喺樹枝上。佢哋嘗試叫醒佢，但係佢唔動。佢哋好悲傷，因為發現隻鳥喺毒酒嘅影響下病咗。最後，佢哋將隻鳥埋喺樹底，用一首歌嚟講再見。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a big lion who lived in the jungle.

He saw a little bird who was chirping near him. The lion wanted to catch the bird, but it was not easy. The bird was flying very fast and the lion was not able to catch it. The lion decided to take it easy and went back to sleep. He knew that he could catch the bird later when he was not feeling sleepy. From that day on, the lion was always careful and never slept when there were birds around.\n翻譯：從前有一隻大獅子喺叢林度生活。佢好強大同勇敢。一日，佢好想睡覺，決定瞓一陣。而佢瞓緊覺嗰陣，開始眨眼。突然間，佢聽到一聲響，就醒咗。佢見到一隻細細嘅雀，喺佢附近喺度喳喳叫。獅子想捉隻雀，但係唔係好易。隻雀飛得好快，獅子捉唔到佢。獅子決定放鬆啲，返去瞓覺。佢知係可以喺唔咁瞓覺嗰陣捉到隻雀嘅。從嗰日開始，獅子一直都好小心，當有雀嘅時候都唔會瞓覺。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nOnce upon a time, there was a clever little bird.
