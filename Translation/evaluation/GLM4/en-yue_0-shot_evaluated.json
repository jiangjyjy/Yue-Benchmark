One day, he found a bottle of wine on the ground. He was curious and took a sip. It tasted funny, but he liked it. The bird started to sing even louder and happier than before. He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up. The next day, the bird's friends found him on the branch. They tried to wake him up, but he didn't move. They were miserable and sad. They realized that the wine was poisonous and had made the bird sick. They buried him under the tree and sang a sad song to say goodbye.",

One of the younger children, who was only three years old, began to cry.  \"Why did it split?\" the child asked between sobs. His father smiled and said, \"It split because it was old and it just couldn't hold us all anymore.\"  The child smiled, and everyone helped to patch up the mattress so it wouldn't split next time. And from then on, everyone made sure not to put too many people on the mattress!",

It was an earthquake! The bird was so scared that he closed his eyes. He tried to stay as still as possible. When the shaking stopped, the bird opened his eyes again and looked around. He saw that all the other birds had flown away. But the stubborn little bird stayed put, determined not to be scared of the earthquake.",
