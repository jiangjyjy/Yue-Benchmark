Mum and Dad were in the garden gathering wood. They were going to have a fire in the evening. Suddenly, a frog leapt out of the wood pile! It was a big frog. Dad was a bit anxious. He didn't want the frog to get away! Mum had an idea. She grabbed a stick and carefully put it in the fire. When it was hot, she took it out and started to burn the frog. The frog jumped and hopped around, but the fire was too hot! Soon there were only some ashes left in the fire. Mum and Dad were relieved. The frog was gone, but they were both anxious. Would the fire be too big? Would they be able to put it out in time before it burned everything? They watched as the fire slowly died down. When it was safe, they went to bed feeling relieved.
