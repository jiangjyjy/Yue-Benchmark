So, the helicopter flew far away. It wandered to a new place where it could be happy. And the bird was happy too. They both lived happily ever after.  翻译成粤语： 古時古時，有一架小直升機。直升機喜歡在空中流浪。它會高高低低地飛，繞著雲朵飛。一日，直升機遇到了一隻大，生氣的鳥。鳥不喜歡直升機。鳥認為直升機太嘈吵。鳥希望直升機走開。直升機不想要鳥生氣。所以，直升機飛得很遠。它流浪到一個新的地方，在那里它可以快樂。而鳥也快樂。他們都過著快樂的日子。
Once there was an oak tree in a meadow. One day, it was a cold day and the oak tree felt very chilly. Then, all of a sudden, the oak tree saw a bright light and started to burn. The flames reached up to the sky and lit up the meadow. Everyone who saw it was very scared and ran away.  The fire turned the oak tree into ashes and soon the meadow was very dark. But then, something amazing happened. The next day, when the sky was bright and cold again, a new oak tree sprouted from the ashes of the old one. It was happy and strong. From then on, the meadow was filled with the beauty of the new oak tree.  粵語翻译： 曾有一棵橡樹長在草地。一日，天寒地冻，橡樹感覺非常寒冷。突然，橡樹見到一道亮光，開始燃烧。火焰升上天空，照亮了草地。所有見到的人都非常害怕，逃走了。火把橡樹燒成灰燼，草地很快就黑暗了。但接下來，有件奇妙的事情發生。隔日，天又亮又冷，一株新橡樹在舊橡樹的灰燼中冒出。它開心又强壮。自此，草地充滿了新橡樹的美麗。
Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy. He loved to look up at the sky and see all the stars in space. One night, he saw a shooting star and got very excited.  Timmy wanted to examine the star, so he asked his mom for a telescope. She gave him one and he looked through it, but he couldn't find the star.  Feeling a little ignorant, Timmy asked his mom for help. She showed him how to use the telescope and together they found the shooting star. Timmy was so happy and couldn't wait to tell all his friends about it.  曾几何時，有個小名子叫提米的小男孩。他喜歡望著天空，看著太空中的所有星星。一晚，他見到一颗流星的，感到非常興奮。提米想研究这颗星星，所以向媽媽要了一架望遠鏡。她給他一架，他望了望，但找不到那颗星星。感到一點無知，提米向媽媽求助。她教他如何使用望遠鏡，一起找著那颗流星。提米非常開心，迫不及待地想告訴所有朋友。
