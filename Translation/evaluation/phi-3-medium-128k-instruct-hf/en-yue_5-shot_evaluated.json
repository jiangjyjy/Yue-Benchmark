The bird started to sing even louder and happier than before. He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up.

The owl flapped its wings and shook its feathers to get dry. After a while, the sun came out and the owl felt warm again. It decided to wait until next Tuesday to catch fish. From then on, the owl always checked the weather before going out to catch fish.\n",
