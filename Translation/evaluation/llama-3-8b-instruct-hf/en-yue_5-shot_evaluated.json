It was an amazing twig. The twig wanted to explore the world. So one day, the twig dropped from the tree. It fell and fell and felt the wind on its branches.  The twig landed in a puddle. The twig was so excited to splash in the puddle. As the twig swished around, it saw all sorts of wonderful things. The twig saw a butterfly, a frog, and an ant.  The twig danced and spun around in the puddle. It was so fun that the twig didn't want to leave. But eventually, the twig said goodbye to its friends and dropped to the ground.  The twig made its way back to the tree and laughed about the amazing things it saw. From then on, the twig was never afraid to drop from the tree and explore.\n翻譯：以前有一條枝，條枝好特別。條枝想探索世界，所以有一日，條枝從樹上掉落嚟。條枝一直掉，感覺到風吹過佢嘅枝葉。條枝落咗去一個水坑度。條枝好興奮咁喺度跳水。當條枝周圍跳嗰陣，佢見到好多好特別嘅嘢。條枝見到一隻蝴蝶、一隻青蛙同埋一隻螞蟻。條枝喺水坑度舞咗，轉圈圈。好玩到條枝唔想走。但係最後，條枝同佢嘅朋友講再見，掉落地面。條枝返到樹度，笑話佢見到嘅特別嘢。從嗰日起，條枝再唔會怕從樹上掉落嚟探索世界。\n\n樣例：\n請將下面呢句/段話直接翻譯成粵語：\nMum and Dad took Lucy to the big field.

She grabbed a stick and carefully put it in the fire. When it was hot, she took it out and started to burn the frog. The frog jumped and hopped around, but the fire was too hot! Soon there were only some ashes left in the fire. Mum and Dad were relieved. The frog was gone, but they were both anxious. Would the fire be too big? Would they be able to put it out in time before it burned everything? They watched as the fire slowly died down. When it was safe, they went to bed feeling relieved.\n",
