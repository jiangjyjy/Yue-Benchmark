One day, he found a bottle of wine on the ground. He was curious and took a sip. It tasted funny, but he liked it. The bird started to sing even louder and happier than before. He sang and drank the wine until he was very sleepy. He fell asleep on the branch and didn't wake up. The next day, the bird's friends found him on the branch. They tried to wake him up, but he didn't move. They were miserable and sad. They realized that the wine was poisonous and had made the bird sick. They buried him under the tree and sang a sad song to say goodbye.",

Sara wanted to share some with Brownie. She took a slice of bread and spread some jam on it. She wrapped it in a napkin and ran to the barn. She found Brownie in his stall and gave him a hug. \"Hello, Brownie,\" she said. \"I have a treat for you. Do you want some bread and jam?\" Brownie nodded and snorted. He took the bread from Sara's hand and ate it in one bite. He licked his lips and nuzzled Sara's cheek. He was happy and grateful. \"Thank you, Sara,\" he said in his horse way. \"That was yummy.

One day, Timmy got very wet and started to feel an itch on his arm. He scratched and scratched, but it wouldn't go away. His mommy told him to pray and ask God to make the itch go away. So Timmy closed his eyes and prayed.  Suddenly, the itch disappeared! Timmy was so happy and thanked God for helping him. From that day on, Timmy learned to pray whenever he had a problem. And even though he loved playing in the rain, he made sure to dry off properly so he wouldn't get itchy again. The end.",
