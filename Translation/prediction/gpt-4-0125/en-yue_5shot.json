Timmy loved to play outside in his backyard. One day, he saw a long snake slithering around. Timmy was scared of the snake, but he knew he had to be brave. He went inside to get his dad, who helped him organize a plan to safely remove the snake from the backyard. They used a long stick to gently guide the snake into a box, and then they took it to a nearby field where it could live safely. Timmy felt proud that he was able to help organize the snake's relocation. From that day on, Timmy wasn't afraid of snakes anymore.\n",
